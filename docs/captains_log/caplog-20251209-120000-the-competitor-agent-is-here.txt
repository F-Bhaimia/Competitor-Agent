Previous Log: None - First Entry
================================================================================

## Summary
Initial Captain's Log for the Competitor News Monitor project. This is an
AI-powered competitive intelligence platform that automatically discovers,
analyzes, and summarizes competitor activity for the membership and fitness
management software industry.

## Current State
The project is in a stable, production-ready state with comprehensive
documentation. The main branch is up-to-date with recent commits focused on
deployment documentation and README cleanup. There are a few uncommitted local
changes (modified README.md, Home.py) and generated pycache/data files.

Key components in place:
- Core crawling engine with Playwright fallback for JS-heavy sites
- AI-powered classification using GPT-4o-mini (11 categories, 3-tier impact)
- Streamlit dashboard with filtering, export, and PDF generation
- Scheduled automation for Windows (PowerShell) and Linux (cron)
- One-command deployment script for Linux servers

## Work Completed
- Project architecture established with modular design:
  - `app/` - Core modules (crawl, parse, classify, summarize)
  - `jobs/` - Batch processing (daily_scan, enrich_updates, etc.)
  - `streamlit_app/` - Interactive dashboard
  - `config/` - Competitor monitoring configuration
- Full deployment documentation created (DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Comprehensive README with architecture diagrams and API reference
- Windows automation script (nightly_update.ps1)
- Linux deployment script (deploy.sh)

## Decisions Made
- GPT-4o-mini chosen for classification (cost-effective, fast)
- SHA-256 hashing for deduplication (company + normalized_url)
- Breadth-first crawling with configurable depth limits
- Parquet mirror for analytics performance
- Streamlit for dashboard (rapid development, good for internal tools)

## Issues Encountered
- None documented in this initial log entry

## Commits Made
- 88af1fb: Add deployment documentation and script
- e517a9c: Clear Future Updates section
- 9a2fbe2: Remove Slack references and license, add Future Updates section
- 0618c05: Remove contact information from README
- 8947f15: Add comprehensive README documentation
- bfafd47: Update README.md
- fafc034: Update README.md
- 8545382: Add comprehensive README documentation
- 1bfeb83: Initial commit: Streamlit app, enrichment jobs, docs

## Mistakes & Lessons
None this session - this is the first log entry.

## Next Steps
- Review uncommitted changes to README.md and Home.py
- Consider adding the generated pycache and data lock files to .gitignore
- Set up the .claude configuration properly
- Test the deployment workflow on a fresh server
- Add monitoring/alerting for crawl failures
- Consider adding tests for core modules
