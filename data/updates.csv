13 Common Weight Loss Mistakes
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:35:59 PM
Many of us have either tried to lose weight or have at least wanted to lose weight and it’s easy to be misinformed or to waste time by relying on the wrong solutions. Here are some of the most common weight loss mistakes.
Solutions for Weight Loss: Common Mistakes You’re Making
1. RELYING ON THE SCALE
One of the most common weight loss mistakes majority of us are guilty of is relying on the scale to detect our progress. Although it can be a helpful tool, especially for those looking to lose an excess amount of weight, it can actually hinder weight loss. First off, this is because most of us don’t understand that there is a difference between weight loss and fat loss. We use the phrase, “weight loss” to describe wanting to lose fat.Second, the scale doesn’t know the difference between muscle and fat, so even though you might be exercising and eating clean, the number might not go down because while you’re losing fat, you may also be gaining muscle in the process. Be mindful of this the next time you look down at that pesky number, because it typically does more harm than good and isn’t always accurate like you think. Learn more about the scale
here
.
2. DOING TOO MUCH CARDIO AND NOT ENOUGH WEIGHTLIFTING
One common myth we are told is to run for weight loss. Too much cardio can actually do the opposite and cause weight gain because your body will eventually burn muscle instead of fat. According to
Health Magazine
, too much cardio can cause the body to store energy as fat and increase your appetite, making you more inclined to overeat.  A pound of muscle burns three times more calories than a pound of fat, so that’s why it’s advised to strength train if you’re looking to lose fat.
3. EATING TOO MANY HEALTHY FOODS
Yes, you can gain weight from healthy food. This is because eating too much of anything is not good. Fat loss takes place with a calorie deficit when you burn more calories than you consume, which is why it’s imperative to practice portion control if you’re trying to achieve weight loss.
4. EATING LESS BUT NOT HEALTHIER
Eating too little and too much both hinder weight loss, especially if your diet is small amounts of processed junk food. Not only is it not enough food to satisfy hunger cues, but junk food lacks nutrients, which leads to deprivation, overeating and ultimately, weight gain. In order to reach your weight loss goals, you need to eat more healthy foods like vegetables, lean meats and whole grains and indulge in moderation.
5. BEING IMPATIENT
Weight loss takes time, and this isn’t just because it feels like forever to see results, it’s actually scientific. It takes 12 weeks of consistency to see measurable changes in your body and often times, most people fail to lose weight because they aren’t patient.So, the next time you see something online or on television that promises to help you lose weight fast, it’s safe to say that you won’t keep the weight off. Keep in mind that even though it might take some time to lose weight, the good news is that it also takes time to pack on the pounds. One good meal won’t make you fit or thin just like how one bad meal won’t make you fat.
6. EATING “DIET” FOOD
We are convinced that something is better for us or will help us lose weight if the label says “diet” or “low-fat.”  Take something that is fat-free for instance.The product has been stripped of fat but replaced with added sugars to make it taste better. According to
Healthline
,
low-fat or fat-free foods contain higher amounts of sugar, which increase hunger signals and cause you to actually consume more calories.Rather than focusing on labels, maintain a balanced diet of nutrient-rich foods like fresh vegetables, protein and whole grains. You’ll have a lot better luck at losing weight this way than relying on diet foods that contain hidden ingredients and added sugars.
7. RELYING ON OUTLETS OTHER THAN DIET AND EXERCISE
Like it or not, there is no “magic pill” for weight loss–at least not for long-term results. There are “fat burners” and crash diets out there that might help you shed a few pounds initially, but the cold truth is simple–you have to eat right and work out to lose weight, and to keep it off, stay away from dieting. It’s not a realistic weight loss approach because people typically don’t maintain it.
8. REWARDING YOUR WORKOUTS WITH FOOD
It’s perfectly fine to treat yourself sometimes, but it’s also easy to get carried away and set yourself back if you aren’t mindful. According to
Reader’s Digest
, a study found that people claimed to have burned more calories than they actually did during a workout and then consumed more food than usual as a reward for exercising. Having that mentality can sabotage your weight loss goals because you can’t out-train a poor diet, so instead, eat clean 80 percent of the time and reward yourself 20 percent.
9. CUTTING OUT TREATS
On the contrary, it’s also a common mistake and habit to feel like we have to deprive ourselves of our favorite guilty pleasures. Once this happens, we immediately crave them more because it’s not realistic or sustainable to quit something we love cold turkey. Just like with rewarding yourself, practice everything in moderation instead of restricting yourself to the extreme.
10. DRINKING YOUR CALORIES
This includes alcoholic beverages and “healthy” smoothies that many dieters drink as meal replacements. It’s easy to ignore liquid calories or not count them, but these calories definitely matter and can easily skyrocket your daily intake. “Healthy” smoothies or shakes often contain hidden ingredients and added sugars that spike your hunger cues, leaving you hungrier and reaching for more food, according to Reader’s Digest.
11. COPYING SOMEONE ELSE’S DIET AND EXERCISE PLAN
Although clean eating and consistent exercise is better than a poor diet and no exercise, what works for someone else might not work for you. Everyone has different lifestyles, body types and habits, and some even have medical conditions that hinder weight loss. If you’re unsure about what works for you, get with a personal trainer that will push you harder during workouts and help your form custom meal plans.
12. DINING OUT TOO OFTEN
Even if you order on the lighter menu or you order something that’s supposed to be “healthy,” there’s definitely a good chance it’s actually not good for you. Sure, some restaurant items are worse than others and it’s important to be mindful when you go out, but many dishes have hidden ingredients and are packed with excess sugar and fat. Limit dining out to once a week and cook healthy meals for the remaining days.
13. LETTING GO ON THE WEEKENDS
You eat clean and exercise Monday through Thursday but once the weekend rolls around you dive head first into greasy food, alcohol and skip the gym. This probably sounds familiar to you since it’s a very common weight loss mistake and is typically the main culprit for stubborn fat that sticks around. By over-indulging on the weekends, you’re taking two steps forward and one step back. Avoid this by limiting alcohol intake and being mindful when you dine out. Moderation is key to realistic and healthy weight loss.

4 Reasons Why Your Gym Needs to Follow Up with Personal Training Clients
Posted by
Club OS
on Oct 18, 2022 2:10:56 PM
At the average U.S. gym,
42% of revenue comes from personal training
. That means that if your club offers personal training, selling sessions to new members and selling more sessions to current clients is crucial to your bottom line.
One of the most important components of successful personal training cross-selling and upselling is your follow-up process. Consistent and engaging follow-up communications help turn PT prospects into clients and PT clients into long-term customers.
Let’s take a closer look at the reasons why personal training follow-up is so important.
1. Build trust and rapport between your trainers and their clients.
The personal trainer-client relationship is built on trust. If your trainers don’t follow up with their clients regularly, it sends the message that they aren’t invested in their progress or don’t care about their club experience.
One weekly email or text checking in on how their last session went can go a long way toward
building lasting relationships with your members
. It can also go a long way toward getting clients to refer other members to your PT program and
refer non-members to your club
.
2.
Increase your chances of keeping PT clients as long-term gym members.
Clients who have a good relationship with one of your trainers are more likely to stay with your gym. This is for a few reasons. The first is that they’ve made a deeper connection with your community. The second is that they’re making strides toward their fitness goals.
Considering
almost 65% of your business is going to come from repeat customers
, spending the extra time to turn those clients into long-term members is worth it.
3. Reduce cancellations.
Following up with personal training clients keeps them engaged. Check-in emails, reminder texts, promotional offers, and other communications can help keep them focused and motivated on their personal training journey.
When members aren’t engaged in personal training, there’s a good chance they’ll either forget or choose not to renew their package. And once they stop working with one of your trainers, they’ll have even less of a reason to stay at your club.
4. Sell more personal training.
A common promotion among gyms is to offer new members a free intro session with a personal trainer when they first join. But how many of your members actually schedule and attend that session? And how many of them pay for more sessions after their free one?
By continuing the conversation about personal training with members after they join or complete their intro session, you increase the chances of them buying PT services. Follow-up messaging is an opportunity for you to reiterate the value of personal training. It’s also an opportunity to encourage them not to put off their fitness goals any longer.
Learn the best practices for personal training follow-up.
Mastering the art of personal training follow-up takes time. But your gym can get ahead by using Club OS’s 5 Best Practices for Following Up with Personal Training Clients!

5 Fitness Content Marketing Tips for Gyms
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:37:30 PM
In today’s marketing world, if you’re not doing content marketing, then your business is not reaching its full potential. Especially in the fitness industry—where there’s so much to teach your audience, and prospects, leads, and members are eager to learn—creating and sharing valuable fitness-related content is crucial for expanding your reach, acquiring new members, and retaining current ones.
The thought of creating quality content your audience wants to read can be daunting, but it’s not as hard as you think
once you break it down
. Since you’re already an expert on all things fitness, all you have to do is turn that knowledge into user content and share it far and wide. We’ve put together our top fitness content marketing tips below to help you get started!
1. Define your target audience.
There’s no point in creating content for people who have no interest in your products or services. That’s why the first step in any content marketing strategy is to
identify your target audience
. As you’re coming up with content ideas and executing them, always write with this audience in mind (or audiences — you may have more than one).
2. Research and brainstorm topics your audience is interested in.
Once you know who you’re writing for, you can determine what you should be writing about. Start simple by thinking about questions your members or prospects ask most frequently, as well as their interests, goals, and problems or pain points. You can also do some research into what your audience is already reading online. Look at forums like
Reddit
and
Quora
to see what questions they’re asking and read through some content from competing gyms.
Doing keyword research will also be valuable for topic ideation, as well as the writing itself. Keywords are words or phrases that search engines use to identify content topics and pull corresponding pieces for users who search for those keywords.
Here’s a list of some free keyword research tools
you can use to get started.
3. Write and post blogs consistently.
Blogging is a great way to educate your audience and start building a content library and online presence.
Research shows
that 48% of companies with a content marketing strategy use blogging and 56% of those who do say it’s effective. Join the ranks of those companies who blog effectively by consistently posting articles about topics your audience cares about.
Through your blog
, you can answer questions, address common concerns, talk about your fitness products and brand, and inform your readers in other ways.
Blogs are also a good opportunity to use your SEO keywords to gain more traction on Google. Blogging consistently — at least 2-4 times per month — will help you build authority and trust with your readers and with search engines.
4. Incorporate other forms of content to capture and nurture leads.
Along with blog articles, it’s important to offer a consistent variety of other content to cater to the different preferences of your audience members. For example, some of your audience may prefer to read a written breakdown of a leg workout you’re sharing, while others may find it easier to watch a video of one of your employees demonstrating it. Some
popular forms of marketing content
include eBooks, how-to tutorials, videos, and infographics.
To maximize the return on your content, create and offer gated content pieces along with your free content stream. Gated content is content that a user has to fill out an online form to access, allowing you to capture their data and put them into your sales funnel. Case studies, topic guides, and eBooks are a few examples of valuable gated offers. Once you have your lead’s information, nurture them with emails that reengage them by offering more content, and slowly move them into your sales funnel.
5. Build a social media following where you can promote your fitness content.
After you’ve taken the time to strategize and create quality fitness content, you need to get people to read it so it can do its job of converting them into members. Most of your club members and similar prospects you want to reach are using
social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook,
TikTok, and so on. Sharing your content on here — whether it’s a link to a new blog post or an infographic breaking down a new workout trend — will help engage your audience, connect prospects with your brand, and promote your content to more people.
Another way to promote your fitness content is through guest posting. Guest posting is when you write a blog article for another business that overlaps with your target audience, such as a nutritionist, and they post it on their website. The benefits are that your content reaches more potential leads and backlinking to your website from another can boost your SEO. You can look for guest writers to contribute to your blog and cross-promote you to their audience as well.
Support New Leads & Members with the Right Gym Management Software
Content marketing is a strategy that takes time to work, but when it does, you’ll start to see new members stream in steadily. If you want to retain those members long term, you’ll need to work smarter with software that streamlines business operations and enhances the member experience.
ASF has the tools you need to run the business side of your gym quicker and more easily, so you can focus on nurturing leads and engaging members. With features like online enrollment and check-in, flexible payment processing, and
Club OS integration
to help you market and build a community, you’ll have everything you need to deliver the ultimate member experience.

5 Gym Membership Pricing Tips
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:39:13 PM
When prospective members are looking for the right gym, price is one of the first and biggest factors they consider. The
average cost of a gym membership in 2021
was $37.71, but that doesn’t mean that price will work for every fitness business. The right strategy for your membership pricing will depend on what you offer, where you’re offering it, and who you’re offering it to.
There are a
number of questions
you’re going to want to ask yourself as you evaluate your pricing model — what’s your membership value, what type of services do you offer, and so on. As you’re gathering the information and insights you need to accurately price your membership, keep these tips in mind to help you come up with the perfect number.
1. Pinpoint Your Revenue Sources
To accurately price your services, you first need to identify all your income sources and determine which revenue streams are your highest. This will help you figure out which services should be priced higher or lower compared to how much they take out of your operating budget.
Along with your standard memberships, some of your other revenue streams might be from personal training, group classes, retail products, fitness challenges and events, or nutrition and other wellness services. If your club management software has
analytics and reporting tools
, you can pull data from there to see exactly which services are bringing in the most and least revenue.
Top Tip:
You can use your point of sale system to increase revenue streams.
Here are some ideas
to get you started.
2. Calculate Your Profit Margins
If you don’t price to profit, your club won’t be sustainable. To
calculate your profit margins
, it’s imperative that you know your operating costs thoroughly. Here are some examples of operating costs to factor in as you’re creating a membership pricing model:
Rent
Utilities
Equipment
Staff salaries
Insurance
Marketing/advertising
Management software
You should also leave room for unexpected costs when you’re determining your profit margins, for things like equipment repair or unexpected closures.
3. Do Competitor Research
New prospects are going to be comparing your prices to those of other gyms as they’re deciding where to join, so you should be doing the same. Do some research into what comparable gyms in your location are charging for memberships, classes, and other services. Gauging existing prices will help ensure you don’t over or underprice yourself. As you’re looking at competitor prices, also consider the value they’re offering. Affordable memberships are important to prospects, but they’re also looking at your
total value equation
.
For example, let’s say your competitor offers a standard gym membership for $20 a month just for access to standard equipment. But with your membership, members get free online classes or the use of your hydromassage chairs. Although you may be in the same area and reaching for the same target audience, you can probably get away with a $30 per month membership because that price tag comes with greater value.
4. Know Your Target Audience
Speaking of target audience, yours is an important factor in your pricing strategy. Understanding your current and prospective members will help you determine how much they’re willing and able to pay for your services. You want to be careful not to price your audience out, but also to maximize your profits with a high enough price point.
When thinking about your target audience in terms of membership pricing, consider your location and demographics. Is your club in a high-income suburban neighborhood? Or a lower income area? Do your services attract more working-age adults or retirees with less disposable income? You’ll also want to consider what services your audience likes, how often they visit, and their fitness goals when determining how much they’re likely willing to pay.
5. Consider Tiered Pricing
Offering different levels of membership and pricing can make your club more accessible to a greater number of people. It also gives you more opportunities to upsell. Once you convert a lead with a lower-tiered price and they begin to use your facility, they’re more likely to be willing to pay for the perks of a higher membership tier.
There are a few different ways you can go about structuring your pricing tiers. The easiest is to offer a basic, standard, and premium monthly membership. Each tier should offer different inclusions and exclusions, such as attending multiple club locations or access to various parts of your club, like a basketball court or pool. You could also offer pricing based on membership length with pay-as-you-go, weekly, monthly, and annual options. If you offer a lot of group classes, you may want to have a separate pricing tier for classes and class packs.

6 Ways to Maximize the Profitability of Your Gym
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:39:19 PM
Fitness professionals are some of the most passionate people out there. Many club owners, gym managers, personal trainers, and even front desk and floor staff are driven by the desire to help others become their strongest, most confident selves.
But that doesn’t mean the money doesn’t matter.
If you want to run a successful and sustainable fitness business so you can keep living your career dreams, you need to make it a profitable one. That’s why we asked some of the most experienced experts in the fitness industry about the not-so-secret strategies they’ve found to be the most successful in making their businesses profitable.
We’ve gathered exclusive insights and advice from Nick Hahn, our VP of Product, Chris Stevenson of
The Empower Group
, Greta Wagner, Executive Director at
Chelsea Piers
, and Jarrod Saracco, former COO of World Gym and
fitness business consultant
.
Here are their essential takeaways for how to make your fitness club more profitable.
1. Increase Membership Dues
Many gym owners are resistant to the idea of raising membership prices. But, Greta asserts, you don’t have to be afraid!
Membership dues are the biggest revenue stream for most fitness clubs. Raising your prices is one of the easiest and fastest ways to boost your profits significantly.
And you don’t have to worry about losing too many members over a price increase. In fact, according to a survey by StyleSeat,
66% of people
don’t plan to cut their fitness spending even despite current inflation levels.
Greta is a firm believer that gyms should raise their prices annually and across the board. That means raising them for new and current members alike. She’s seen plenty of success with this at Chelsea Piers.
They’ve increased their prices by about 6-10% each year and have only lost 1.7% of their members per year, on average. Their average profit increase? Almost $20,000.
So, have confidence in what you offer! Members who value your service won’t be scared away. And you’ll end up with more qualified, price-resistant members who are willing to spend more money at your club.
However, you do need to be strategic about increasing gym membership prices. Be sure to
research the pricing in your market
, evaluate competitor pricing, and identify the price threshold for your demographic (i.e., how much you can increase before your target market stops being willing to pay).
2.
Don’t
Waive Enrollment Fees Blindly
One common strategy clubs try to entice new members to sign up is waiving membership enrollment fees. Jarrod argues that if your gym is running this promotion constantly, then there’s no longer any value or incentive to it.
You’re better off focusing on creating value for new members, he says, and differentiating yourself from the competition. Zero enrollment fees can help you do that, but only when used effectively.
For example, you can use an offer of waived enrollment fees as a bargaining chip to get new members engaged with your club right away. You might offer to waive the fees if they sign up for personal training with their membership too. Or agree to credit the fee back to their account if they check into the club at least 10 times within their first month.
Ultimately, Jarrod found that when his fitness clubs waived the enrollment fee, the average churn rate was the same as when they enforced the fee. So, why not collect on that money or use it to drive more spending or engagement?
3.
Turn Personal Training into a Profit Center
Chris has worked with many gyms to help them build a robust personal training program throughout his career. That’s how he knows that it has the potential to be your second biggest revenue stream after membership dues.
According to Chris, you need two things to run an effective personal training program at your club—a great personal training experience and a great PT sales process.
Although many trainers have the great PT experience nailed down, they’re not as strong when it comes to selling that experience. So, your job is to train them.
Start showing your trainers how and when to engage a prospect, follow up with them, and close the sale. Train them in this right from onboarding, so they can feel confident and start making your program profitable right away.
And make sure you know your personal training penetration rate, or what percentage of your members are buying PT. That’s how you can keep a pulse on how effective your sales training is and whether your employees are providing the PT experience your members want.
Following up with clients and interested members is especially important for your penetration rate. According to internal data from clubs using ASF and/or Club OS, gyms who follow up with brand new members have a 20% PT penetration rate, on average.
You can also support the PT sales process by putting systems in place to
help your staff with engagement and follow-up
. This could mean automating personalized emails to go out at certain times in the member journey or categorizing members by engagement level, so trainers know who to talk to.
4.
Know When (& When
Not
) to Add a New Service
It can be tempting to try to cash in on every new fitness fad that comes around. But those fads often die out as quickly as they rise. And even if they stick around, it doesn’t mean they’re right for your members.
When it comes to adding new services at your fitness club, Greta says you shouldn’t shy away from exploring, but cautions you to be careful and strategic. These are the questions she recommends answering before you make a serious investment in a new service offering:
Does your demographic want it?
Does your demographic
need
it?
What’s the true revenue potential/what can you realistically charge?
What would be the true cost of adding the service? (Don’t forget about hidden costs like floor space, staff training, and marketing.)
Can you start small and test interest in the new service before you dive in completely?
As with any big business move,
do your research first
and be realistic. Just because you
can
offer more doesn’t mean you
should
.
5.
Deliver a Great Online Member Experience
Everybody knows that to make your gym profitable you need to have a great member experience. But not everybody realizes that your member experience doesn’t start when someone walks in the door—it starts even sooner.
Jarrod likes to think of the member journey in different “experience zones.” The first experience zone? The internet.
More and more people are checking out gyms and signing up online these days before they even step foot inside. Data from our clubs show that in January of 2023, there had been a 24% increase in online joins since the previous year.
That means that your members’ experience begins with your online presence. So, make sure you have a strong one that’s consistent with your brand.
6.
Keep Employees
Engaged
& Informed
We hear and read a lot about member engagement in the fitness business industry. But what about employee engagement?
Most gym owners recognize that it’s important to retain a satisfied staff. Not everyone realizes, though, how important engaging your employees and keeping them informed really is for your profitability.
Your team needs to know what’s going on at your fitness club if they’re truly going to serve your members. Knowing about current programs, specials, and other member highlights allows them to personalize their communication with as many members as possible. Giving employees access to club data can help with this too.
When it comes to employee engagement, Chris puts it simply—when your employees are engaged, they’re more productive. When they’re more productive, they provide a better member experience. And the better your member experience, the more profitable your club is.
And the data agrees with him. According to employee engagement research, companies with highly engaged staff have
21% higher profitability
than companies with a disengaged workforce. Increased engagement also leads to
higher earnings per share
.
So,
measuring gym staff loyalty
and investing in ways to engage them will pay off in dividends.

7 Hiring Stats You Need to Know
Posted by
Kevin Talley
on Oct 3, 2019 12:30:00 PM
Every September, the air cools, the leaves drop, and lights shine bright over football stadiums across the country. But this time of year isn’t just for tailgates and pumpkin spice lattes, it’s hiring season. Sandwiched between the lazy days of summer and the hectic weeks of the holidays, September through October is traditionally a busy staffing period you can’t afford to let slip past.
With the January rush only a few short months away, now is a critical time to staff your club’s team. The run-up to the New Year is an important opportunity for new staffers to learn their roles and met the wave of January 1st signups head-on. Here are seven critical hiring stats to give you insights into the state of staffing.
1. The Industry is Growing
Uncle Sam forecasts a bright future for the fitness industry. The
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
projects a 13% growth rate for the personal training and instructor field by 2028. Compared to the national average, that’s a highly accelerated growth rate.  Investing in a quality training staff now can keep you competitive and profitable as your field of competitors continues to grow.
2. Hiring Isn’t Cheap
It takes money to make money, or perhaps more specifically here, it takes money to hire someone to make you more money.
SHRM
finds on average, it costs $4,129 to hire one employee in the United States. This price tag is just one of the many reasons it’s important to hire the right person the first time. Once you have a great team member in place, it will be well worth the money.
3. It’s a Candidate-driven Market
In a nearly fully-employed economy, applicants can be choosy and put off accepting an offer until the right fitness business comes knocking.
Glassdoor
reports 69% of job-seekers will turn down an offer if a company has a bad reputation. If your club has a negative rep thanks to dissatisfied former employees, strive to address these issues or you’ll lose your best candidates to your competitors.
4. Competition for Talent is Fierce
The talent pool is currently shallow thanks to low unemployment. The National Federation of Independent Business estimates 45% of small businesses found too few or no qualified applicants for job openings. If your job posting doesn’t immediately draw dozens of qualified resumes, don’t get discouraged. You may have to play more of a waiting game than you’re used to this year.
5. Ask Your Employees for Referrals
How do you find that MVP employee who consistently goes above and beyond? LinkedIn reports
48% of businesses credit employee referrals
for their quality hires. Leverage your staff members’ natural networking abilities to identify great professional talent. You’ll likely land an awesome new team member and reduce the time and cost of your hiring process.
6. Keep Qualified Resumes
While we hope every hire will work out for the best, sometimes it just isn’t a good fit.
BambooHR
finds 22% of turnovers happen within the first 45 days. It’s best practice to keep strong resumes on file. You can pull from this backup file in a time of need and prevent your club from the pains of being short-staffed.
7. U
nderperforming Players Hurt Your Whole Team
Mistakes happen, especially in hiring. Resumes and in-person interviews can only tell you so much. Unfortunately, when the wrong person gets the job, the costs go beyond dollars.
Monster.com
finds 34% of business owners estimate wasting over 50 hours of time on their most recent wrong hire. If it feels like waiting to fill a position is a waste of time, consider how much more time you’ll lose training the wrong person.

7 Ways To Increase Club Revenue
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:35:12 PM
The livelihood of any successful business is to keep the income flowing. Aside from memberships, there are plenty of club money-makers. Here are some ways to increase your revenue.
HERE’S HOW TO INCREASE GYM REVENUE
1. TAKE YOUR CLUB MOBILE
Your members check their phones regularly, so if you’re not already using
My Member Account Mobile App
, you’re missing out on some revenue-generating opportunities. With the touch of a finger, members can quickly and easily purchase additional training and events and can access club promotions and offers.
2. SELL TO CURRENT MEMBERS
Instead of focusing solely on prospects and new memberships, increase your dollar signs by selling club merchandise to current members through Point of Sale software. Offer anything and everything that might benefit a member and their fitness goals like workout gear, step trackers, supplements, class bundles, training sessions and protein shakes.
ASF Point of Sale and Inventory Management applications
allow your staff to easily ring items up and quickly track your inventory.
3. OFFER PREMIUM MEMBERSHIPS
You’ll always get members who want the bare minimum, and even though higher prices typically steer people away, remember that higher prices mean more value to your members, especially if your club offers a range of package deals that they can compare before making a decision. Neatly display the membership levels on your website in a way that conveys the value of the premium membership.
For example, your basic membership that costs $10-$20/month might restrict members to only equipment and free weights, but if the member purchases premium level, they can receive a certain amount of training sessions or group classes and extra perks like spa and towel services for $10-$15 more a month. Amplifying what your gym offers ups the value of your club and is an effective way to incentivize your members. Don’t be afraid to show membership prices either–people appreciate transparency.
4. UPSELL TO CURRENT MEMBERS
This is the same thing as making a simple sale to an existing member, but it’s kicking it up a notch through accurate targeting and technique. To effectively accomplish this, you’ll want to target members who are on your basic membership plan. Narrow this list down by running
reports
of all these members. Once you’ve done that, gather their emails and send out an email blast promoting an offer of your choice. This could be a sale for an add-on service or an offer to upgrade to premium level. Promote this via
My Member Account Mobile App
as well for more results.
5. OFFER TRAINING
Whether big or small clubs, training equates to 9 percent of total club revenue, according to
IHRSA
. ASF clients have seen as high as 20 percent, so it’s a huge money-maker and can be part of package deals or add-on services. You can also offer different types of personal training like one-on-one and small group training and vary your pricing based on the value. Small group training has recently been an uprising trend within the fitness industry, according to IHRSA. Train legacy members who are
looking to become personal trainers
. It’s easier to train new personal trainers than to recruit existing trainers.
6. OFFER NUTRITION & HEALTH COACHING
Whether your members are trying or have tried to lose weight, we are no strangers to the never-ending epidemic. According to
Time
, about half of Americans said they tried to lose weight in 2018 and majority of those people still don’t realize that lack of nutrition is the main culprit.
Not only is nutrition where your members fall short, but it’s where your business is missing out as well. Offer nutrition and health coaching packages for members to purchase. Even if your club is already generating big numbers without this added perk, nutritional guidance is a huge opportunity to up your revenue. Promote these services on My Member Account Mobile App and run monthly reports to determine the popularity.
7. OFFER CHILDCARE
Another service that can aid in higher revenue is childcare. Many of your members have kids, so allow them to work out in your facility without the hassle of finding a babysitter. Learn more about childcare services

Actionable Ways to Address COVID-19
Posted by
Kevin Talley
on Mar 26, 2020 7:00:00 AM
The spread of COVID-19 has disrupted numerous industries across the globe, and as we all know, the fitness industry is being hit hard by its effect. It’s an unprecedented situation in the modern world and can often lead us to feel like there is nothing we can do. In this spirit, we compiled a list of actions you can directly take now to help both your members and your club’s staff.
For Your Members
1.)  Let them know what you’re doing
Email inboxes full of special messages from companies outlining exactly how they’re addressing COVID-19 has become a bit of a punchline online. It can seem like customers don’t especially care how your business is responding, but remember there’s a big difference between receiving an email from a business you made a single one-time purchase from three years ago and a business you are actively paying a membership fee to each month. Sending your members an email updating them on your club’s status and how you will handle the coming weeks of the pandemic is a great way to reassure members who are currently debating if they really need to hang on to a gym membership with everything else going on.
2.) Extended Memberships
Eventually, things will return to normalcy and it’ll be time to reopen your doors. The current goal should be to retain as many of your current members as you can, so when you do reopen, you have a full gym floor. Extending the length of memberships to reflect the time lost during closures is one strategy to acknowledge your members’ inability to use your services. It shows you’re proactively working to ease their frustration and rewards them for sticking with your club through these uncertain times.
3.) Provide Nutritional Tips
Social distancing is leading to a lot more home-cooked meals. Help your members maintain a healthy diet by offering nutritional tips and recipes via email and social media platforms. This is a great way to keep demonstrating the value of your club for members even when they aren’t psychically visiting the facility. Grocery stores are seeing incredibly high demand so some ingredients are going out of stock. If possible, stick to simple recipes with widely available ingredients.
4.) Invite Members to Share Their From-Home Workouts
When your fitness club is open, it’s a community. Keep it that way online by inviting members to share their from-home workouts and experiences on your social media platforms. This is an effective method to continue building your club’s community and also to give your members a social outlet. It’s easy to feel isolated right now, so encourage members to share and connect!
For Your Team
1.) Follow Local and State Announcements
Your top priority for your staff is to make sure they’re healthy and safe. The best way to do that is by following all local and state regulations. This is a fluid situation that requires staying current and responsive to public health ordinances and best practices. An added benefit to keeping up with governmental updates and listening to experts is that you can filter out the misleading or incorrect information cycling through social media and other media outlets.
2.) Prepare a Closure and Reopening Checklist
If your city or county hasn’t yet faced mandatory closures of non-essential businesses, now is a great time to prepare for the possibility it could happen in the coming weeks. Creating a closure checklist ensures you and your staff can effectively but quickly close up the club when the time comes. Likewise, a reopening checklist helps you ramp back up operations in as little time as possible. It also ensures no critical task is left unfinished as you welcome back your members.
3.) Check-In with Your Building’s Landlord
Now’s a great time to reach out to the property owner(s) of your building to see how they are addressing the COVID-19 outbreak. While there’s no guarantee your building’s landlord will offer a pause or reduction of your lease, it’s still important to start a dialogue with them now. This is an unprecedented situation, leading to a lot of cooperation amongst businesses. We all have a common goal to help each other and our business weather the pandemic.
4.) Run Virtual Training
You’ve probably already considered the possibility of virtual training as a way to continue offering value to your members. Your members look to you to help guide their fitness journey and virtual training is an excellent way to keep doing just that. But keep in mind, virtual training is also a huge benefit to your trainers. It’s an opportunity for them to keep doing what they love and keep earning commission. You’ve built a great team, now more than ever, your members need their expertise to continue feeling upbeat, confident, and healthy.

4 Tips for Building Lasting Relationships with Your Gym Members
Posted by
Club OS
on Feb 3, 2022 4:26:03 PM
It’s no secret that a gym is nothing without its members. After all, that’s why you spend so much time trying to win over new prospects and acquire new leads. It’s important to remember, however, that retaining those new members is just as crucial to the success of your fitness business as it is to acquire them in the first place.
The key to long-term client retention — whether you’re a big box gym, small studio, or
personal trainer
— is to put the time, effort, and resources into creating deep-rooted relationships that promote loyalty. In this article, we’re going to give you tips on building those lasting member relationships that will help your club thrive.
1. Talk to Them About Their Goals
According to a study
by the American Society for Training & Development, participants who told someone else about their goal had a 65% chance of achieving it. We all know that when gym members are hitting their goals, it drives retention. By offering to be the “person” they share their goals with, you can set them up for the level of success that keeps them coming back. Discussing your members’ goals with them also communicates that you care about their progress and results, setting the foundation for a positive long-term relationship.
Ask a new member about their goals early in the sales and onboarding process. Don’t stop the goal talk here though. Check in with members regularly, ideally biweekly or monthly, about their progress in person or through email, text, or mobile push notification, to show that you’re invested in their fitness journey.
2. Maintain a Steady Stream of Communication
Truly lasting relationships with gym members go beyond the time they spend in the gym. Communicating with members regularly via emails, texts, and online content keeps them engaged even when they’re not in your club. Although you don’t want to bombard them with messages, a consistent communication schedule will go a long way in maintaining a connection.
Here are a few important types of communications to set up for your members:
Personalized messaging.
Sending members a birthday text or email when they hit their annual membership anniversary signals you value them on an individual member — i.e., they’re not just another sales number to you. With Club OS’s
automated follow-up feature
, you can even set reminders and create template scripts to personalize for these milestones.
Educational resources.
Using your online channels to share content like workout tips, healthy recipes, motivational tactics, and so on, offers more value with your membership and in your member relationships.
Check out this article
to learn more about the top types of marketing content audiences want to see.
Gym news and updates.
It’s important to keep members informed about what’s happening at your club. Sending a monthly newsletter or other communication with new services, new staff, featured members, and similar highlights is a good way to keep them interested and show them you’re constantly trying to offer something new.
3. Create Group Exercise & Accountability Programs
Encouraging members to build lasting relationships with each other helps strengthen their relationship with your gym. Community is important to gym members and increasing club loyalty. People like working out with other like-minded people, as it can help keep them motivated, hold them accountable, and develop new friendships. In the
Les Mills 2021 Global Fitness report
, two-thirds of gym members said they prefer working out in groups, and live classes in the club were found to be nearly twice as popular as livestream classes at home.
Running group classes, challenges, accountability groups, and activity clubs are all ways to keep members engaged with you, give them the opportunity to engage with each other, and help them find success. For example, try creating a private Facebook group for members to practice accountability, or a club for bikers or runners to get together and do their favorite workouts. Here are some other
group workout trends
to consider offering in 2022.
4. Organize Member Appreciation Events, Programs & Campaigns
Making members feel like a valued part of your community through their entire lifecycle is vital to retention. There’s a saying about how you should never stop dating your spouse, even after you’re married — well, you should think of your members the same way.
Here are a few effective member appreciation tactics you can start with:
Recognize your members’ accomplishments
. Recognition for their hard work motivates gym-goers to keep coming back. Try something like a bulletin board or weekly social media posts featuring a hard-working member (#MemberMonday anyone?). Don’t forget to reach out individually to congratulate members for hitting goals or milestones too.
Customer appreciation events
. Appreciation events such as a free class for members with a special guest instructor, happy hour or social event, or wellness workshop can be a good token of appreciation.
Customer appreciation gifts/campaigns
. Discounts and freebies, like a percent off membership after X years, merchandise rewards card, or a
referral program
, add real value to long-term memberships that makes members feel important to your club.
Streamline & Automate Member Engagement to Build Valuable Lifetime Relationships
With Club OS technology, you’ll have all the tools you need to build meaningful connections with members at your fingertips. Automate communications to ensure no member falls through the cracks, then analyze club activity to see if your efforts are working. When you run your fitness business smarter, you have more time to put into forming solid member relationships.

Case Study: World Gym Group Onboards New Member Management Software for All 12 Locations
Posted by
Club OS
on Oct 23, 2023 5:05:08 PM
The World Gym Quebec Group successfully owns and operates 12 gyms across Quebec. As the largest franchise group in North America within the World Gym network, they faced several challenges around their customer data management and member onboarding process.
The introduction of Club OS's
club management software
enabled the World Gym Quebec Group to modernize their member experience. This allowed them to better support their customers in their native language, comply with region-specific regulations, automate their administrative tasks, and revolutionize their member sign-up process—all using Club OS's array of
smart business software tools
.
Want to learn more about World Gym Quebec Group's success with Club OS? Read the
full case study here
.
Challenges World Gym Quebec Group Faced around Membership Management
The World Gym Quebec Group previously relied on traditional pen-and-paper processes for member sign-ups, leaving room for human errors and inefficiencies. Quebec's consumer-focused guidelines also necessitated a membership software that could manage customer data exclusively in French—which their previous business software didn’t support—and in compliance with the province's guidelines.
They needed all this, plus an online joining process to modernize the member onboarding process.
These challenges prompted the need for automation and powerful membership management software. They needed a platform that could handle member enrollment in the correct language while ensuring data migration without any loss or errors.
Club OS/ASF's industry-leading gym management software was selected as its partner to address these challenges.
“We recently converted 12 locations all at once. Their customer success team supported us onsite for training and onboarding and was on point and fully engaged to ensure the process was very smooth. The process went very well, and we’re super happy.”
- Sammy Chehayeb, Owner, World Gym Quebec Group
Overcoming Obstacles with a Tailored Club Management Software Solution
With a large member base and all their data needing to be transferred—in addition to 12 locations going live at the same time—the franchise group wanted to ensure seamless migration and onboarding. This would ensure the transition would be as smooth as possible for all parties involved.
From there, Club OS/ASF’s product & support teams worked together to make sure that our
membership management
platform checked all of World Gym's boxes. They also developed a plan to smoothly transfer all existing data and get their team up and running on ASF as seamlessly as possible.
Data Migration
Club OS/ASF seamlessly incorporated all of the World Gym Quebec Group's members' information, payment types, and historical data from their previous software before the official platform launch date.
On-Site Technical Support
A dedicated technical team, made up of customer support, product management, and other experienced personnel, was on site for over a week to ramp up operations and offer real-time assistance as staff were trained on how to use all the tools Club OS/ASF has to offer.
Seamless Implementation
The implementation process was a significant success, with all 12 locations brought online simultaneously to ensure a seamless launch with consistency across the entire franchise.
A Transformative Partnership
Club OS/ASF proved to be the ideal partner for the World Gym Quebec Group. By offering a comprehensive gym management software solution, ASF addressed their challenges related to data migration, language requirements, and automation.
Through their attentive support, dedication to customization, and ability to manage complex implementation workflows, ASF showcased their commitment to becoming a true partner to their customers' fitness businesses.
The World Gym Quebec Group now enjoys a modern and streamlined process that caters to the needs of its diverse member base, setting the stage for continued success and growth.

Club OS Helps Gyms of All Sizes Acquire More Members
Posted by
Club OS
on Jan 15, 2024 6:56:05 AM
Club OS simplifies the marketing and sales process for gyms while maximizing conversations through the member journey, leading to better lead conversion
For gyms and fitness studios, getting new members is no easy task. Public interest, the act of signing up, and payment processing all represent omnipresent hurdles keeping fitness businesses from acquiring new customers. However,
Club OS
knows how to help its customers clear these challenges in one leap.
[ClubOS]
works as a bridge between prospective gym members and gyms themselves. Powered by sales and marketing automation, Club OS
provides
the software gyms need to sell more memberships and keep their current members from jumping ship.
Acquire
More Members
Club OS
simplifies the marketing and sales process while maximizing conversations through the member journey. With comprehensive and flexible solutions for every consumer touchpoint, they
provide
the right product integrations to help improve any area of your business.
David Canter
(Head of Revenue, Club OS)
,
a 25-year industry veteran who worked during the fitness industry’s foundational era, now believes
he’s
moving beyond the 21st century with Club OS.
“Our products tell your full business story,” Canter said. “When I joined this industry, there was a lot of paper, a lot of phone books — absolutely no accountability or tracking mechanisms. Fast forward 25 years, everything we’re doing is intelligent, it’s smart, it’s integrated.”
Bringing leads through involves Facebook Ads integration, referral programs, or guest waivers. Club OS then efficiently organizes that data for its customers.
“When you get a lead, this is your one opportunity to talk to this individual at a specific time when they’re interested in a membership and bring them through as a member,” Canter said. “We’re targeting individuals smartly and
communicating with them in their preferred way
.”
“
It’s
a comprehensive way to be efficient, to be smart, and to communicate in a way that makes sense for this day and age. It allows us to avoid spending a lot of money, but see a high return on investment,” he added.
Solutions for Fitness Brands Big & Small
Club OS does not discriminate on size when it comes to working with its customers. The software adjusts to
different levels
,
operating
across large franchises with 50 locations as well as single-unit facilities.
“
Our platform is intuitive enough for anyone to set up and use, but we also offer comprehensive support to all,” Canter explained of the Club OS solution. “Whether you have a marketing team supporting your 20-club chain, or you are running a single-location facility, we’re here to help ensure your success.”
Canter credits his lengthy experience across all sides of the fitness business with helping him and Club OS take these steps forward. Canter formerly worked with Sports Club LA, (now Equinox), Crunch Fitness, Exos, and Town Sports International.
“I’ve been on the vendor side, I’ve been on the operator side, and I think that perspective helps me,” Canter said. “Having held the operator role for years, I know what they need from a software and partner
perspective, and
am able to
work with my team at Club OS to ensure
we’re
meeting those needs. The industry
experience
I’m
bringing with me to Club OS, deepens the level of support our teams can provide to our clients.”
Numbers
Don’t
Lie: Why Gyms Trust Club OS
It’s not difficult to find information that supports Canter’s words. On average,
organizations utilizing Club OS see a 22% increase in conversion via their outreach methods compared to those who don’t use the platform.
Text blasts
saw a 20% return in campaigns to reacquire old members as well.
“If you’re getting 100 leads in a month, to get 22 more of them to join your club, it’s a significant lift from a membership perspective,” Canter said. “Thousands of clubs use it (Club OS), many of them are using all the capabilities including our personal training and group exercise follow-up messaging, ancillary revenue programming, and notifications.
It’s
not just about helping them to add this member using Club OS,
it’s
about helping them to meaningfully engage with these clients, fostering long-term relationships, and building a community around their brand.”
Aided by Canter, Club OS views the upcoming calendar year as a major growth opportunity
,
with
some of the company’s most exciting launches in its history will begin to roll out in 2024.
“I get little goosebumps on my arms when
I think about what
lies ahead. The next 12-18 months will be transformative for us,” Canter said. “What happens after that I can’t even imagine, but it’s going to be amazing.”

They advance our business through professional excellence, they enrich our company culture through diverse backgrounds, and best of all, they make jokes -- mostly bad, but we love that. Every so often, we’ll be sitting down with team members for what we’re calling “Club OS Five-by-Fives.” The premise is simple: Five questions about the awesome work they do at Club OS and five questions about their lives outside of work, which we assume are just as awesome.
This week, we interviewed Quality Assurance Manager, Daniel Driver.
At Work
1.) How long have you been with Club OS, and what are your day-to-day duties?
I've been here… four and a half years. Wow, time flies! A typical day sees me working with our engineering team to coordinate efforts, testing new improvements and catching high-risk bugs so that our customers have the smoothest experience possible.
2.)
What previous education or work experience do you have that helps you find success in your current position?
In terms of education, I'd have to say very little -- at least formally! I graduated with a History degree and a music minor. Technology has always been a passion of mine though, and I'm one that rarely leaves well enough alone. I've modified most of my personal electronics and, as you can imagine, this territory comes with a lot of troubleshooting and problem-solving. Previously, however, I have worked with other large CRMs and provided support and implementation for customers across all levels, from single-owner businesses to multi-location companies.
3.) What is regression testing, and how does it improve Club OS?
Regression testing is a step that all new features and fixes must go through before making their way to public release; this step is particularly important as it's performed in addition to standalone testing of each feature. Once everything in a release has been approved separately, we create a test environment that contains all changes in a single place. This allows us to ensure that everything plays nicely together and that a new change introduced in the code doesn't have any negative effects on an existing function or feature of Club OS.
4.)  How do you gauge success in quality assurance?
Success is gauged by user feedback after a release. As the old saying goes: no news is good news! This allows us to turn our focus to legacy features that were released prior to having proper quality assurance and improve every aspect of Club OS.
5.) You've recently started lending your voice to Club OS Help Desk videos. Why are the videos valuable, and where can they be found?
The value of videos cannot be overstated. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been tinkering with a personal device and have had to turn to YouTube in order to find a detailed walkthrough of a particular process. While having written articles is very helpful too, they can still be cumbersome at times as they require your full attention. It can be likened to the recent boom in audiobook popularity. We may not all have time to sit down and read a novel, especially when it’s much more convenient to pop in some headphones and listen. Add some helpful visuals that reinforce the topics being discussed, and you’ll have digested the information in no time. If you’re ever interested in learning more about the system, or if you just want to bask in the dulcet tones of my pleasant voice, head over to
help.club-os.com
After Work
1.) Outside of work, what hobbies or activities do you pursue?
I like to keep myself well rounded so I try to engage in many different activities. Of course, there is the typical ""video games"" answer but that's boring! I love making music, exercise, skateboarding, and believe it or not, yard work. I've felled a few trees recently and it's pretty invigorating! I also got my first project car not too long ago, so I'm taking my tinkering to a new level which has been an incredible learning process!
(Daniel's project car, a 2001 Ford Mustang)
2.) You recently moved into your first home -- congrats again! What's your favorite part about homeownership?
Honestly, I answered that in the previous question -- I'm loving working outside and generally just having space for everything. If I had to distill it into a single idea though, I’d say that my favorite part is taking something that exists in a certain state, pouring yourself into it, and being able to enjoy and share the results.
3.) You and your fiancée are currently planning your wedding. What wedding-planning advice would you give newly engaged couples?
DON’T DO IT! Haha, I’m kidding, of course. This is a tough one to answer because it means such different things to each individual. I suppose the most encompassing piece of advice I can give is to not hesitate. Time moves a lot faster than we tend to think and it waits for no one! This is a big event for everyone, including the guests, so you’ll want to have your ducks in a row far before you think it’s necessary.
(Daniel and his fiancée, Shawntel, catching a Houston Astros game.)
4.) Would you rather live for free in your dream house but it's located in a town of under 200 people, or rent-free in a studio apartment in a major metropolitan city?
That depends on the day. Idealistically, I'd love to be in my dream house, but realistically I need human interaction. That's why I moved back to Austin, it's the best of both worlds!
5.)  If for the rest of your life, you could only listen to one album your favorite band produced, which album would it be?
How dare you. My favorite band is Weezer, for better or for worse, and their discography is so inconsistent it's hard to say… but if it's the REST of my life, I think I'd have to say that their 2016 White Album is the winner -- although that's so tough to put into writing. Again, how dare you.

Club OS Five-by-Five: John McGrew
Posted by
Kevin Talley
on Aug 22, 2019 5:30:00 PM
Here at Club OS, we’ve put together a team of exceptional individuals. They advance our business through professional excellence, they enrich our company culture through diverse backgrounds, and best of all, they make jokes -- mostly bad, but we love that. Every so often, we’ll be sitting down with team members for what we’re calling “Club OS Five-by-Fives.” The premise is simple: Five questions about the awesome work they do at Club OS and five questions about their lives outside of work, which we assume are just as awesome.
This week, we caught up with Senior Manager of Customer Success, John McGrew.
At Work
1.) How long have you been with Club OS, and what are your day-to-day duties?
I've been with Club OS for about 3 months. Day-to-day, I have responsibility for our Help Desk, Implementation, and Account Management functions.
2.)
What previous education or work experience do you have that helps you find success in your current position?
I think I'm coming up on a decade that I've been launching and leading B2B, customer-facing teams in various high-growth environments, including software. As you might imagine, lots learned along the way. Nothing more important perhaps than finding smart, curious folks who have the ability to empathize with a customer, and can aggressively solve those customers' business challenges. If I can do that well, I find that we're generally doing a good job.
3.) You manage multiple teams. How do you keep your teams connected and working toward the same goals?
The bulk of my organization is located in our Austin, TX office, which certainly helps. But honestly, whether remote or in-office, I'm finding this one to be pretty easy. When working with the team, it’s difficult not to notice the passion that exists for the Club OS product and what it can do for our customers' businesses and lives -- it's impressive. That commonality is definitely rare but does pay large dividends in the pursuit of organizational goals. For my team members that work in our office, there's a lot of cool stuff going on culturally as well that I think helps everyone stay both aligned and focused, and though I can probably take credit for none of it, I'm one of the chief beneficiaries, nonetheless.
4.)  ""Customer success"" is a broad term. How do you define success for Club OS customers?
We have a pretty broad diversity of customers, ranging from family-run, single-club owners to multi-national franchises. Across that spectrum, I'd define our customers' success by the impact our solution has on both their top and bottom lines. Of course, there's a lot that goes into that as the software can do quite a bit, and that’s where my teams work their magic. It’s pretty fun to watch them demo certain features or teach new functionality, and as the customer gains proficiency, be able to witness the financial results that ensue. Seeing our team and product help customers run their businesses more efficiently and more profitably, is when I know we’ve done what we set out to do, which is ultimately improving lives through fitness.
5.) In your opinion, what sets the Club OS customer success teams apart from other CRM companies in the fitness market?
I won’t speak to what I’ve seen specifically from other CRM options in the market, but I can say that in addition to the passion I noted, we have a pretty strong depth of industry knowledge and experience across the team. We have quite a few folks that have either worked in or run gyms in previous lives, which is obviously a helpful complement to understanding the nuance of software. As well, I’m pretty proud of the support and training ecosystem that we’ve been investing meaningfully in. I do think this has become a key differentiator for us. Smaller providers have a harder time making the investments required to deliver world-class, dedicated training and ongoing support. It’s definitely neither easy, nor cheap. The larger, less purpose-built solutions have scale challenges with training and support and often enough, customers will need to pay for anything other than the most basic level of training/support. And even then, it’s generic and difficult to fully support the needs of fitness businesses. As a program, we’re focused on fitting nicely in between.
After Work
1.) Outside of work, what hobbies or activities do you pursue?
With young kids and a really wild, 95-pound dog, I’m not sure what a hobby looks like these days. My wife and I seem to have evolved into bona fide foodies in recent years and Austin happens to be a pretty good place to eat and drink, so I’d say beyond hanging out with the family, I’m about eating. My BBQ and pizza games are pretty strong, but I do constantly stay on the hunt for the best of both.
2.) As a father of two, is the second child easier because you can draw from your past experience as a dad or harder because, well, now there are two of them?
I don’t know if I’ve found it easier necessarily, although the confidence of having kept the first one alive for this long certainly helps. With only two hands, there’s definitely an additive effect felt with the second, and I frankly have no idea what folks do when there’s a third. But in all truthfulness, it’s been the experience of a lifetime. Kids, highly recommend them.
3.) Your hometown of Fort Worth is commonly associated with Dallas as part of the DFW metroplex. Is there a heated rival between the two cities, and if so, why is Fort Worth superior?
I’m not aware of any rivalry within the FWD metroplex.
4.) As a TCU alum, what was the best part about attending a smaller private university rather than a larger public university?
I’ll tread lightly here as our Austin office is 15 minutes away from one of the largest public universities in the country, and I may not make it to my car if I’m not careful... Lots to love about the small school experience and education, and if I had to do things over again, I would not have changed anything. Ultimately, it’s about finding the right fit and there are lots of considerations -- including having a football team that has beaten Texas 4 out of the past 5 years. Go Frogs!!!!
5.)
You can fly for free to any foreign city but when you arrive you only have a passport and $20 in your pocket, which city would you choose and why?
I’m a big fan of remote, tropical beaches and if you’re only sending me with $20, I’m probably searching for a strong dollar and purchasing power. At first glance, somewhere remote in Indonesia looks to be the winner.

Customer Spotlight: How Fit Factory is Using Club OS to Boost Member Acquisition
Posted by
Club OS
on Jul 5, 2022 4:25:39 PM
With so many gyms, studios, and other fitness services available in person and online, new member acquisition can be a challenge for your fitness business. At Club OS, we offer a collection of tools to help you convert more prospects with less work, but we know it’s not always easy to see how those tools can be used in your own gym. So, we thought showing you what our software looks like in the hands of one of our most successful customers could inspire you in how to use it in your own strategy.
Without further ado, meet
Fit Factory
—a Club OS club that’s killing it in memberships, group classes, personal training, and more!
Getting to Know Fit Factory
Fit Factory is a full-service health club with locations in Massachusetts and Texas. With thousands of square feet of luxury amenities and a variety of elite fitness services, they’re much more than your average gym. Here are some of the programs they offer to help members meet their goals:
Group classes
—barre, yoga, Pilates, FIT Total Body Burn, cycling, kickboxing, Tabata, and more
Personal training
—small-group and one-on-one training
Functional Fitness I
(F.F.I.T)
Virtual classes
Along with a suite of fitness classes and training programs, Fit Factory goes the extra mile to provide other wellness services too. Many locations offer saunas, steam rooms, tanning,
nutrition guidance
, and even babysitting for their members.
Anyone looking for a gym where you can be part of a community that’s fun, supportive, motivating, and goal-oriented is sure to feel right at home at Fit Factory.
Introducing Brandon Bairos
Our Club OS marketing manager, Mark Fletcher, was lucky enough to be able to sit down with Fit Factory’s Director of Operations, Brandon Bairos, to learn more about how their business harnesses
the power of Club OS
. Brandon has been with Fit Factory for over seven years, advancing from Personal Training Director to Program Sales and Operations Director, and now Director of Operations.
Below we’ve highlighted some of the most insightful parts of our interview that shed light on how Fit Factory grows and nurtures their membership base.
Could you tell us a little bit about how long you’ve been with Club OS and what turned you on to the software?
I think we signed on with Club OS four years ago. As we started scaling, we started to get more aggressive on the sales side of things. We needed some better lead flow and communication, and a better way to manage club-level sales at a regional level. That was a big part of it. With having our salespeople in each club fully focused on lead generation and conversion, we needed the regionals to be able to manage that and ensure that all the contacts were being made on a daily basis.
So I understood why we signed on to Club OS. We had a different software before and that wasn't really what they were known for. They were a CRM, but it wasn't really great.
In your opinion, when you first started learning Club OS as a personal trainer, what was your initial reaction to the top-down saying, “Hey, we're going to use this new CRM tool. We need you guys to adopt it.”? Were you excited about it? Did you find it helpful?
Yeah. I was a fitness director overseeing personal training in the clubs, and then I got promoted into a regional role where I started to get more involved in club operations. Luckily Club OS was already there when I signed on and was very simple. That was my favorite part about it. The interface is pretty easy for somebody that doesn't have much training in it. You can see where your lead follow-ups are right then and there, and easily email or text them with the click of two buttons.
I also like some of the reporting that you can access with the calls and texts going out on that day. And you can have a leaderboard as well that compares your location to the other clubs. That was my first experience using Club OS. And I was like, yeah, this is pretty cool.
We've had some customers say that their member lifecycle or member retention has increased. Are there any measurable results that you have seen as a result of using Club OS?
Conversion rates, yes. I'll start with our Texas locations. We opened our Texas locations almost three years ago. At first, we didn't have Club OS up and running and our conversion rates were around 40-45% from prospects to members. Since we rolled out Club OS, they jumped right up to 60-65%.
What features within Club OS do you find have the most impact on your business in helping you reach your objectives of scaling or optimizing the customer experience?
I would probably say the web lead and lead outreach for prospects more than anything. The [personal training features] I can't say enough about yet because we just had our onboarding call two days ago, but I'm ecstatic about it because one of our challenges with seven locations is ensuring our sales guys put in the time and the effort on the calls and the texts to leads. So, once we roll that out, that'll be nice. That'll make things a little bit easier for the personal training regional manager.
But club side, it's the prospect outreach. That's pretty simple. We can easily see when our conversion rates are down and that's when we're not making the touchpoints on the prospects that we should be.
Is there any particular Club OS feature that you feel like you couldn’t live without and use every day or every week?
The dashboard is great—that's really helpful. That is something that I check regularly. I mean, everything that we do on the marketing end for drip campaigns and [other marketing campaigns] is centered around Club OS. Without that, I think we would not be converting as well as we are, that's for sure.
But for myself and my team, [who are more] on the operation side, the automated cadences, texts, emails, and being able to easily set up and update our scripts has been super helpful and easy. I would definitely lose sleep if all of our salespeople were just putting their own spin on everything and lacking consistency across the club. So having that ability to easily go in and change our cadence or our script a little bit at the club level is very helpful.
Key Takeaways: The Importance of Streamlined Communication & Visible Club Reporting
By focusing more on communication with leads and refining their outreach process, Fit Factory has been able to increase their conversions and grow their membership base—without increasing their workload. Automated text and email scripts and cadences have made it easy for Brandon and his team to stay on top of every new prospect who moves through their funnel.
Tracking these communication efforts also allows them to clearly see gaps in follow-ups and correct them before a lead is lost. The result? More effective marketing campaigns, more consistent communication, and more members gained.
Achieve Fit Factory-Level Success When You Partner with Club OS
Brandon and the Fit Factory team are gaining new members and more profits by working smarter, not harder—and you can too. Club OS sales engagement and marketing automation features can put you on the path to success while making your operations smoother and simpler.

Customer Spotlight: Saving Time & Reducing Workload at Urge Fitness
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:35:27 PM
When you run a fitness club, every moment of your time is precious. Between operational responsibilities, marketing efforts, and focusing on creating the ultimate member experience, most club owners and operators could use an extra 10 or so hours in their day.
Although we don’t have the power to make your day any longer than 24 hours, ASF and Club OS can give you some of your hours back by making it easier and faster to do your job. That’s just what we did for Urge Fitness—one of our biggest customers using our software to make things simple across club locations.
Getting to Know Urge Fitness
If you’re looking for an upscale fitness experience for an affordable price,
Urge Fitness
is the place to go. A full-service gym with locations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, they market themselves as a destination for individuals and families alike.
Urge is known for its
cutting-edge group classes
, like aerial yoga, and
extensive children’s fitness programs
. Here are a few of the other programs and
amenities they offer
:
Personal & group training
Massage therapy
Smoothie bar
Saunas
Weight loss programs
Reflecting their commitment to their members’ health and wellness, Urge Fitness is open 24/7, 365 days a year.
Introducing Mya Domencio
To gain more insight into Urge Fitness and how they’re using ASF and Club OS to run their clubs more efficiently, our marketing manager, Mark Fletcher, sat down with Mya Domencio, the Director of Marketing for Urge Fitness. Mya is also their Regional Fitness Director, so she has many responsibilities when it comes to keeping all their locations growing and running smoothly.
We’ve pulled out some of the most enlightening parts of our interview with Mya to take a deeper dive into how she uses her club management software to help manage her heavy workload.
Could you tell us a little more about your responsibilities as the Marketing Director at Urge Fitness and how Club OS and ASF help you tackle those?
Yeah, I have a lot of roles actually. I do marketing, which I do a lot with
Club OS
for, and then I’m also the Regional Fitness Director of all the gyms. I plug in all the classes, hire the trainers, tell them where they’re going, and direct all that too. Then I market those classes. So I sort of wear two hats and get split up all the time.
Club OS really plays into both the marketing side of my job and the scheduling side, so I’m very familiar with it. It’s been the biggest help to do blasts, automatic campaigns, and text messages. We find it really simple to use.
ASF
I really like because it’s easy to move over classes, open up windows, and get a good view into the class schedule across clubs. It’s simple to follow, crisp and clear, and the reports are amazing. To be honest, if I didn’t work here and was to open up my own gym somewhere else, I would probably use the same products.
Have you noticed an increase in [lead-to-member] conversion rates as a result of using some of these tools?
Yeah, so with our pre-sale [Club OS] is nice in terms of conversion because we have an urgency in our marketing—like “stores opening soon,” “must sign up to get this offer,” or “prices are going to increase.” So we get a lot of conversions through our pre-sale and a lot of online signups in general. You can get a lot from Club OS when used correctly.
What was the lead process like before using Club OS?
A different gym I used to work for used to do excel sheets of leads and I think a lot of gyms did that way back in the day. It was the biggest nightmare. So I think in general [Club OS] was like the greatest thing ever to everyone because it was like, “Oh my God, a system we can put our leads into and we can just type things up.”
In the fitness industry, there’s not a lot of this stuff created if you think about it, like not a lot of organizational tactics in terms of big box gyms right now. There’s not a lot out there. So, to have this and have it all in one easy access space, even for our trainers…we can see everything that’s going on across the board at all times.
And I work at all four gyms, so I don’t physically have to be at a gym to know what’s going on, which is nice.
Do you have an idea of how much time these automations have saved you?
I would say probably hours.
Is there one particular tool from ASF and Club OS that you use every day for your role?
The multi-event editor. I use that so you don’t have to individually move everything over. It’s way quicker. We’re huge clubs and we have turnaround left and right like everyone else in the business, so if a trainer leaves, to be able to switch everything fast and easily…I use that all the time.
We [also] use reports every single day to be able to see all the accounts we entered, cancellations, and add-ons. We fill out a report of what came through in revenue and it’s quick and easy. It takes us about five minutes to type it up.
[Another feature] I use every single day is blast campaigns. Let’s say an instructor [for a class] changes, which happens a lot, and we have a sub tonight. I go right in and have templates made to say, “so and so is teaching this class today at 5pm,” and it’s nice because it will blast out to everyone. It takes probably 5-10 minutes and then the link to sign up is right there.
Key Takeaways: Easy-To-Use Club Management Software Saves You Time & Drives Success
With processes simplified by user-friendly club management features, Urge Fitness has been able to ensure leads and members don’t fall through the cracks when it comes to communication—and save their team hours of work at the same time.
Automated marketing tools
and
easy class schedule management
have made it easy for Mya and her team to keep members informed about what they need to know. And with digital lead tracking, they can grow their membership base even more.
Simplify Success at Your Club with ASF & Club OS
Your club’s strategies for success can be just as effective and easy to implement as the ones they use at Urge Fitness. All you need is the right set of tools to get them in place.
Club OS and ASF work together to make running your gym simple. From payment processing and group fitness scheduling to automated email campaigns and quick reporting, you’ll have everything you need to succeed at your disposal.

How Forward-Thinking Club Owners Leverage Technology
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:37:09 PM
In the past, the health club industry’s reliance on technology was almost solely in the area of transactions. In this day and age, however, there are so many options for using technology to enhance the
member experience
and stand out as a fitness brand.
Club owners can also leverage technology to understand members’ needs and find new ways of meeting them. As consumers become more and more tech savvy, it’s important for club owners to follow suit or risk falling behind.
How can your fitness center take advantage of some of the latest digital trends and stay competitive? Below are some of the best ways to make your technological investments count.
Seamlessly Connecting with Members
The idea of fitness itself has changed dramatically over the past several years. Rather than thinking of fitness activities as a product to purchase or fitness centers as a destination to visit, consumers view fitness as a part of their lifestyle.
With so many fitness possibilities available, consumers can now compare options and find what fits into the fabric of their daily lives. In order to be the solution members are looking for, gyms must adapt their member management styles and
connect with members
in new ways.
For most clubs, the best way to do this will be through the use of
advanced gym membership software
and member-facing technologies that provide frictionless experiences. Members should be able to quickly and easily sign up for and check into events, enabling them to focus on the value they’re getting out of their membership rather than the hoops they must jump through to actually use it.
Connecting with members also means providing the types of fitness experiences they need in the moment. These days, that may mean access to valuable digital content or use of digital wearables during an in-club activity.
Going the extra mile to integrate all these channels of the membership experience will not only increase member satisfaction, but also unlock new opportunities for crucial data collection.
Optimizing Data & Providing Personalized Experiences
Gone are the days of tedious membership tracking on spreadsheets or hard to use software programs. Advanced software solutions exist that enable club operators to accurately and automatically track data while also providing plenty of opportunities to put that data to use. This saves time and energy that could be better spent cultivating relationships with members. It also allows for the collection and optimization of valuable information.
Data can be utilized to offer personalized support for your members at every stage of their purchase journey. Nowadays, forward-thinking fitness clubs take advantage of the power of algorithms to gain a 360-degree view of member behavior patterns and preferences. Club OS has an advanced CRM and automated marketing system offering a clear and comprehensive synopsis of each member’s needs, so you can exceed their expectations and increase retention rates.
Tracking technologies are also essential for upholding the strengths of your club and assessing its weaknesses. Using the wealth of data provided by advanced software systems, you can take a proactive approach to increasing future stability by laying a solid foundation for a stronger, healthier business.
Increasing Revenue Opportunities
Digital innovations offer opportunities to capitalize on the data they provide. From personalized outbound marketing to individually tailored recommendations, new technologies and software solutions can employ data to target products and services to those who are most likely to make a purchase. With the right member-facing technologies in place, members can easily make in-app purchases that help them reach their goals and find greater value in their membership.
These solutions don’t only increase efficiency for clubs and their members. They also increase revenue. As long as technologies are implemented purposefully and with authenticity, they can be used to eliminate the pain points of members and offer an individualized purchase journey. With a fitness experience that is synced across platforms and aligned with their unique goals, members are more likely to integrate your brand into their digital lifestyle.As our world becomes increasingly driven by technology, digital transformation is a must for fitness clubs. From personalizing the member experience to utilizing data to gain valuable business insights, applying data-led strategies to nearly every facet of club operations will be essential to success in the new era.

Dos & Don’ts of Text & Email for Member Retention (+ Customer Examples)
Posted by
Club OS
on Apr 23, 2025 3:29:11 PM
Originally published as part of the Athletech News State of the Industry Report:
Member Success Blueprint: Acquisition, Retention, and Engagement Strategy
With new year’s resolutions often focusing on health and fitness, that period receives a natural kickstart year in and year out. But what of the following months?
The real challenge begins when motivation fades and individuals start to give up said resolutions earlier than they’d like to admit—and earlier than gym owners would hope, creating a frustrating cycle of churn.
The right tools can help combat this cycle, but knowing
how
to use the tools and implementing best practices could be the difference between members canceling before they hit that 30-day milestone and becoming lifelong advocates for your brand.
Text and email campaigns represent one of the most effective ways to bring members in—or push them away. Here's how to ensure the former and avoid the latter.
💪
Do Use Segmentation to Deliver the Right Message at the Right Time
Not all members and leads should receive the same promotions, messaging, or cadence. A new lead considering a membership needs different touch points than an existing member who hasn’t checked in for a while. Plus, if the text or email they receive is the first one in a while and it’s relevant to them, they’re more likely to respond or take action.
💪
Do Include a Call to Action
Literally tell your members what you want them to do. What’s the step you want them to take? Call, reply, fill out a form at this link? Let them know, it’s as simple as that.
💪
Do Add Urgency to Your CTA
Add time-based promotions to drive action. Send older leads an exclusive offer for a free personal training session if they join before the end of the month. Incentivize members whose contracts will expire in the next 60 days a free month if they renew early.
Customer Example
After launching a “last chance” promo campaign targeting expired members to encourage renewals before prices went up the following month, a ClubOS customer saw a 37% increase in monthly renewals—rising from 1,841 to 2,528 in the same month year-over-year. This growth translated to a 30% decrease in lost revenue.
💪
Do Mix in Non-promotional Touch Points
Add variety to the purpose of your communications. Reach out on a member’s birthday (with
ClubOS ONE
you can automate personalized messaging!) and offer a free smoothie or special discount on merchandise. Do what you can to bring some joy!
Customer Example
When one of our top customers began sending check-in texts, recurring newsletters and non-promotional messaging consistently, they saw a decrease in monthly churn. Their monthly churn rate dropped from 8.62% in 2023 to 3.28% by 2025, enabling them to retain an additional $11,000 in monthly revenue compared to 2023.
🚫 Don’t Use Emojis Frivolously
Using too many emojis can trigger spam filters causing carriers to block your messages, meaning only some of your list will receive them. Also, emojis are usually counted as multiple characters, which will count against your total allotment and is something to keep in mind for cost savings.
🚫 Don’t Text Too Often
Text tends to feel more invasive than email. While text messages relay better engagement rates compared to email, overdoing it will lead to a faster unsubscribe because it’s that much easier to opt out.
Customer Example
When one of our top CRM customers sent just one text per prospect through the month, they achieved a 1.32% response rate—far surpassing the average of 0.23% from gyms sending 2.3 texts to prospects. Their conversion rate was also double the average of other customers.
Bonus Tips
Looking for more ways to keep your messaging impactful? These extra strategies offer a fresh perspective on what works—backed by real customer experiences.
🌟
Avoid Talking About Losing Weight
Rather than talking about dropping pounds, shift to mentioning self-care with your communications. Talking about overeating on the holidays doesn’t help anyone and leads to members feeling shame and guilt instead of motivation, empowerment, and drive.
🌟
Keep It Clear and Concise
Your members are busy—many are juggling workouts alongside packed schedules. They’re skimming emails (like most of us do!), so make it easy for them. Get to the point quickly: What are you offering? What do they need to do? Why should they care? Clear, direct communication increases engagement and ensures your message stands out.
🌟
Prioritize Automation
ClubOS reports that most clients experience an increase in their collections rate (typically 96%+) when they switch from another vendor. This is largely due to features such as automated billing, collections support services, streamlined reporting, and actionable insights from member activity analytics. It’s a boost that brands may need as gym attendance naturally slows down in late winter or early spring.

Email Marketing Best Practices to Grow Your Fitness Community
Posted by
Club OS
on Jun 7, 2023 12:12:53 PM
Author
Nick Hahn - VP of Product at Club OS
Having a strong email marketing strategy is one of the most cost-effective methods to grow your community of club members.
Data shows that email marketing campaigns produce an average of
$36 for every $1 spent.
That’s an unbelievable 3,600% return on your investment.
77% of email marketers reported a boost in engagement and 37% plan to increase their email budget.
It’s safe to say that email marketing is far from dead—it’s alive and thriving.
Community building and relationship nurturing is a cornerstone of our industry. So, it’s obvious why email marketing is a preferred communication strategy for fitness clubs.
In fact, according to Club OS survey data,
66% of profitable gyms
leverage email marketing to engage with their member community and prospects.
But where do you even begin?
In this article, we’ll cover a handful of best practices for email marketing to help you get started.
Building an Email Subscriber List
Let’s start with understanding how to build a solid prospect email list. This list is critical to the success of your email campaign that is focused on boosting member enrollments and effectively engaging with current members.
Here are some of the more effective strategies for collecting prospect emails:
Start a referral program.
Place a newsletter signup form on your website or a QR code at your front desk.
Run paid advertising for a new promotion on Facebook or another social platform where you interact with your audience.
Create a signup form for people to take a gym tour and post it on social media and your website.
Sponsor local sports or charity events to build brand awareness in your community.
When you first start building an email list, you may be tempted to buy email addresses from a third party. But this is almost never a good idea. We know it sounds easy and enticing, but more often these lists will be more trouble
￼
than they are worth.
There are many laws that dictate how businesses are allowed to communicate with consumers such as the
CAN-SPAM Act, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
and the
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
￼￼
If you are caught using a purchased email list, consisting of people who did not opt-in to receive your emails, you run the risk of facing heavy fines.
Not to mention, these lists typically consist of poor-quality leads and end up
not being worth the price
.
You must be patient as you build your email list. It will take time and effort. But if you do it the right way, then your list will consist of people who want to engage with your fitness brand and will eventually become loyal customers.
The Best Types of Email Marketing Campaigns and How Often to Send Them
Over 347 billion emails are sent and received worldwide every day, according to
Statista
.
That means if you want to stand out in your prospects’ inboxes, it's critical that you’re strategic, creative, and consistent about your messaging and email cadence.
Strong Subject Lines = Strong Open Rates
How you write the subject line is one part of your messaging strategy that can impact whether a prospect will even open your email.
The email subject line is what your prospect will see first before they even open the email. So, it’s important to have something that will draw their curiosity and attention.
Here are a few tips that will help boost your open rates whether your prospects are on desktop or mobile devices.
The shorter the better. Best practice says to keep your subject lines between 35-45 characters (this includes spaces!), and no more than 60. Be succinct, without being too vague.
Use emojis, but with purpose. Use emojis to complement the messaging, but don’t use them to replace words.
Take advantage of the preheader text. The preheader is the line of text that appears under the subject line when viewing an email from the inbox. The subject line and preheader can work together to build curiosity and encourage recipients to open the email. Email service providers typically default to populating the preheader with the first line of text from the body copy, so it’s important to be thoughtful about this.
For even more insight into subject line success, we asked one of our team members, who is an expert in email marketing and has 15+ years in the field, for their input on the highly debated topic of subject lines, and here were their top tips:
Use personalization/customization—i.e.,
Carrie, we are here for your gains!
Ask a question—i.e.,
Are you ready to start your
fitness
journey
, Carrie
?
Use a number—i.e.,
5 Reasons You Should Include Recovery in
Your
R
outine
For more tips on how to optimize your subject lines, and how to succeed at email marketing in general, check out this free
eBook resource.
The First Email You Should Send to Your Subscribers
Now let’s get into what kind of content you should produce for your email marketing campaigns.
The first email you should send to your new subscribers is a welcome email that explains what they can expect from your email communications, including how often they can expect to receive them.
From there, one of the first email content pieces you should prepare is a newsletter incorporating a few different elements.
Below are some ideas that we’ve seen work for our customers, feel free to use them all, or just a few. You could also separate each of these content pieces into individual emails to spotlight any discounts, new service offers, or other promotions.
Promotions
—these help attract new prospects or upsell existing members.
Your Group X class schedule
—this can be a helpful nudge to those members who haven’t taken a class yet and to encourage the avid class-goer to try something new.
Member success highlights
—gathering testimonials about your gym’s services (such as PT or group classes) that highlight a member’s fitness success is a great way to boost your credibility.
Plus, it can help build loyalty with members, because you make the highlighted member feel special, and other members may strive to be featured in the next newsletter!
Staff highlights
—show a little personality and make your brand relatable by letting your audience get to know your team through your newsletter. This will also help your members and prospects feel more comfortable walking into your club.
Customer reviews from third-party sites like Google
—
98% of people are reading online reviews for local businesses.
Your target audience will trust the word of others more than they will your staff or brand. These reviews provide non-biased proof of value to your prospects about your fitness club.
For more ideas on what you should send to your prospects check out this
guide to email marketing.
When You Should Send Your Emails
Now that you know what kind of email content you should send, it’s time to nail your email cadence (how often you send emails).
Email marketers across the industry have their preferred approach to how often you should email your subscribers.
The right cadence is different for every industry, business, and audience. But with a little time and some trial and error, you’ll be able to figure out what works best for you and your members.
We recommend you start with a biweekly email cadence. Once you are producing enough relevant content, then begin to gradually increase your frequency to weekly.

blog article here

BONUS TIPS FROM CLUB OS
Here are some additional tips from the Club OS team that will help optimize your email marketing campaigns.
Use Templates.
Using email and campaign templates will help you save time and deliver brand consistency.
Schedule email campaigns ahead of time.
Once you have figured out your email cadence, create future campaigns and schedule their release date/time.
Be strategic with your promotion dates.
Our data shows membership enrollment spikes in January, August, and November due to seasonal events like new year’s resolutions, kids heading back to school, and Black Friday. If you offer summer memberships or sports camps, May is an ideal month to promote, as parents prepare their kids to be home for the summer.
Create some hype before the promotion starts.
Make sure to create some anticipation before your promotion begins. For the best results, we recommend emailing the promotion announcement a few days before it starts.
Then, keep the hype going by sending an email the day the promo starts, and don’t forget to send another reminder email 1-2 days before the promotion ends.
Review and understand your campaign analytics.
You can use your campaign analytics to track certain performance metrics (click-through-rates, open rates, conversions) that will help you determine the success of the campaign.
Reviewing email analytics will help you better understand if your subscribers are engaging with your subject lines and the content you deliver.
Once you launch a campaign or two, take it to the next level by testing different email subject lines. A simple test could be splitting your list in half and running one subject line to list A and a different subject line to list B, then see which has a higher open rate.
Always include a call to action (CTA) in your email content.
The CTA should drive prospects to enroll in a gym membership or engage with your content (e.g., click on a link). If you don’t have a CTA, you have nothing to measure success.
Get the Tools You Need to Execute Your Email Marketing Strategy with Ease
The most effective way to execute any email marketing strategy is to use the right tools to do it.
As a club owner, you need a marketing automation platform designed specifically for fitness clubs that can scale with you as your business grows.
Club OS offers the most powerful communication tools in the industry.
With dynamic automation features and so much more, you can ensure your prospects are engaged at every step of the member journey.
Club OS will take your email marketing to the next level while also saving time for what matters most to you—your members.

Take Your Martial Arts School to New Levels
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:37:16 PM
Solomon Brenner and Michael St. John, Co-Founders of the Martial Arts Collective, lead an organization of 22 martial arts schools in the Philadelphia area. Recently, they’ve partnered with Dave Kovar, an icon in the martial arts world, to put together something that has never been done before, The Martial Arts CEO.  Together they’re helping martial arts school owners escape middle management and truly become the CEO of their business and today they’re sharing their top 5 Tips to make sure your school is ready for the fall season.
1. Check for White-Glove Clean
Cleanliness is key. Martial arts studios and fitness facilities around the world have revamped and overhauled their cleaning procedures to ensure the safety of their students and members. This should always be part of your process. Check to make sure all frequently touched surfaces and areas throughout your studio are frequently being sanitized and held to the highest cleaning standards possible. Every morning should begin with members of your staff starting with the front door and working their way to the back of your facility to make sure your school is spotless. Be sure to replace any used or torn equipment. Make sure all training areas are properly wiped down after every use. Your students will thank you for taking extra precautions for their health, and your school will look more inviting to prospects!
2. Train and Re-Train on Your Systems
This refresher should include best practices for every human touch point from answering the phones to warmly greeting students at the start of their first class. Put time aside each day to role-play any scripts and go over any potential scenarios – there’s no sense in having an influx of new students if your procedures aren’t ready! You should be constantly on the lookout for new best practices and creative ways to enhance your school’s training systems. There’s no need to fix something that isn’t broken, but at the same time, don’t be too attached to your existing methods. Even a small improvement can pay big dividends to your school in the long run.
3. Remind Your Students About the Importance of Training Year Round
It’s imperative that your students keep training all throughout the year. You’ll be able to make sure they stay up to date on skill and technique — and guarantee you’re constantly building your revenue streams. Your messaging during class needs to focus on perseverance and training through time-management obstacles. Share these types of lessons via
Facebook and email
as well as during classes.
4. Keep the Connection With Your Students Strong
With hundreds of schools and fitness options on the market today, it’s important to make sure your students feel valued and know that you’re personally invested in their journey with them. Forging those special connections is more important than ever, and checking in on each student’s progress will make them feel welcomed and special. Send a personalized video to each family congratulating them on training through the summer and commending them on their grit to train through challenging times. Martial arts is a family affair, and taking the time to know the parents, siblings, and grandparents is a great way to strengthen the dynamics at your school. The stronger the relationship, the longer they’ll be a student.
5. Keep Your Marketing Momentum Going
This blog might focus on improvements you can make at your school during the fall, but progress doesn’t end there. Posting on Facebook and social media is extremely important for growth and advertisement, but there are other ways you can demonstrate that you’re prepared to go the extra mile. Keep an eye out for local fall events where you can promote your school. Look for opportunities to hand out flyers promoting the benefits of martial arts and what your studio can offer. Try reaching out to local elementary schools and daycares to expand your existing clientele. No idea is too crazy, and the possibilities are endless.
Let the Martial Arts Collective Strengthen Your School!

They’ll show you how you can take your school to new levels with their industry-proven programs. Accelerator clients get school-growing perks such as access to the team behind this multi-million-dollar organization, a standing invitation to join their daily team meetings, and access systems required to run a successful school, including everything you need for marketing, enrolling new students, retention, classroom management, instructor development, and much more. School owners no longer have to feel alone; you can tap into a network of support in the trenches who will help your school perform at an elite level.

Case Study: How World Gym Tucson Enrolled 1000+ New Members in Presale
Posted by
Club OS
on Dec 19, 2023 7:14:35 AM
World Gym Tucson is one of the newest locations to join the World Gym network and recently hosted its grand opening in Tucson, Arizona.
World Gym (Tucson) partnered with the Club OS/ASF team to form a strategic plan around how to use our integrated software solution to maximize revenue and drive member enrollment before they even opened doors to the public.
Through a highly proactive approach, Club OS/ASF was onsite to support and train World Gym Tucson's staff during the 90-day presale period and beyond, leading to over
1,000+ new member signups within 30 days
and a seamless grand opening.
Read the full World Gym Tucson Case Study here
.
Driving 1000+ New Members Before Their Doors Even Opened:
During the 90 days prior to the club’s opening, Club OS/ASF provided a red-carpet experience by collaborating on World Gym Tucson's grand opening strategy and providing comprehensive, onsite training to ensure the gym's staff could use our software effectively. This led them to crush their grand opening goals and achieve a seamless grand opening for their new site.
World Gym Tucson utilized Club OS/ASF to run pre-sale marketing campaigns that would help them achieve and exceed their membership targets within the first 30 days. Staff were also trained comprehensively around our member management and payment processing tools to ensure that all new gym members had a remarkable gym experience from start to finish.
World Gym's personal trainers also found the Club OS/ASF platform ideal for scheduling and managing client communication, allowing them to focus on selling more memberships, improving their member experience and creating training plans instead of devoting their time to manual or administrative tasks that our all-in-one solution could automate for them.
Software Implementation, Onboarding, Training and Launch in 90 Days
or Less:
The in-person training provided by the Club OS/ASF team allowed for seamless onboarding of all staff members. Our dedicated Customer Success team was onsite at World Gym Tucson for over a week to provide more in-depth training to the entire team and collaborate on a blueprint for their successful launch.
This, paired with the software's user-friendly interface and intuitive features, made it simple for staff to quickly get up and running.
""Being that this was my first time opening a gym, I leaned heavily on my franchisor and their strategic partners. The most important one being our software provider, and both teams, ASF and Club OS were phenomenal in their proactive approach, support, and training.  They really did a great job in helping us get set up, staying on track and training the staff here.  Their teams went above and beyond and continue to provide excellent service and support.  We wouldn't be experiencing this early success without them.""
- Phillip Krausch, President of World Gym Tucson
The support from the Club OS/ASF team did not end after the grand opening. They continued to provide ongoing support to World Gym Tucson, meeting with the gym's leadership team multiple times per week to address any questions or troubleshoot issues that arose as they navigate owning and operating a new location. This unwavering support played a crucial role in the gym's early success.
World Gym Tucson: A Success Story
By harnessing the potential of marketing automation for highly impactful text and email campaigns and joining forces with Club OS/ASF for early education and support, World Gym Tucson has achieved exceptional success in the fitness industry during both the pre-sale and grand opening phases.
As a premier fitness club, World Gym Tucson exceeded their membership goals, amplified their already robust collection rate, and crafted a smooth experience for staff, certified personal trainers, and members alike. This cements World Gym's position as a leading fitness training provider with a growing gym membership and industry-leading customer experience, setting a new benchmark for gym owners, health clubs and fitness studios.
Opening a New Fitness Business Location? Let Club OS/ASF Do the Heavy Lifting For You
Club OS/ASF's dedication to ongoing support and enhancement ensures that fitness studios, gyms and other health clubs will continue to prosper and expand in their respective communities.
Club OS/ASF's on-site training and education—combined with an integrated software solution that can handle everything from lead acquisition, customer management, automated marketing and more—has proven to be a transformative partnership for World Gym and hundreds of other leading fitness businesses and franchises.

Gym Technology Defined: What is GymTech?
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:39:06 PM
It was mid-January when some of us from Club OS and ASF met outside a warehouse in Littleton, Colo. The purpose was to review the final stages of construction for an enormous tradeshow booth.
Within the two organizations, one a marketing and sales tool and the other a club management and billing solution, there had been talks about combining efforts for the upcoming IHRSA. The solutions themselves worked well together, though talk of a combined offering was still in its early stages.
As we gathered, and surveyed the structure, we agreed that gyms need the functionality of both logos on this booth, but they need a host of other functionality as well to cover the member journey.
By our estimation, there were about 50 other booths that would be at IHRSA, with other brands, some competing with our own, that could join in the construction. We left it there but considered building out a comprehensive list while at IHRSA of the tools we thought our customers could really benefit from outside of our own.
Well, you know how it all ended up, don’t you? There was no IHRSA.
Like the rest of the industry, we’ve had plenty of time to take stock of the new. Now that we’ve been in the throes of COVID-19 since March, the challenges facing our industry are shockingly pertinent to the ideas we began discussing in that warehouse in January.
Now, more than ever, business leaders need simple resources to understand the landscape and how to leverage the tools within it.
Enter GymTech.
What is GymTech, exactly? On the surface, it’s an organizing principle to make sense of the vast and complex technology landscape that the modern fitness business has to navigate.
Here’s the headline version: The GymTech landscape below defines what we believe are the most important technology needs, nine total, in order to cover the entire member journey. The needs are, for the most part, in linear order from the touchpoints you would have with prospects to the repeat interactions with your members as you continue to engage and, hopefully, retain them.
Our goal was not only to demystify the overall landscape but also to offer a bit of a compass, providing some key cardinal directions and some clarity about where you are and where you should likely go.
What’s important for us here is that our GymTech landscape, as we’ve chosen to define it, isn’t simply a bit of sales collateral, where all roads lead directly to our product. Yes, we have a role to play within the model, but more importantly, you’ll recognize many logos here that aren’t our own.
The distinction is that the logos we’ve included, we believe, provide products that are designed in a way to uniquely address the growth and operational issues facing fitness businesses
specifically
. Of course, there are market-leading software and service vendors out there that everyone from your local gym to the law firm downtown know all too well. We’ve excluded them, again, because while they might be “impressive” tech, they certainly aren’t GymTech.
There’s been much talk of “ecosystems” in our industry, especially as it relates to technology—and even more as it relates to COVID-19 impacts. So you can imagine the utility of our landscape definitions being helpful in selecting your specific ecosystem of choice to cover the member journey.
However, and we feel it necessary to be explicit here, our concept of an “ecosystem” of solutions differs from some of our competitors in one key way: they want to define it for you, including the logos. We don’t. In each category of needs, we show multiple tools, not just the single tool we want you to consider.
In the coming months, we’ll be diving even deeper into this idea, providing some insights on how to use this information to assess where you are in covering the member journey. We’ve even created a handy one-sheet that lets you see what GymTech your business might need based on its size, which you can
download here
.
Along the way,
please let us know what you think
. How have you been defining and navigating this landscape? What have you learned? What are we missing? We expect this topic to continue to evolve as we enter 2021 and confront the next set of challenges and opportunities that await us.

How Gyms Can Leverage Technology to Increase Per-Member Revenue
Posted by
Club OS
on Aug 8, 2023 7:00:00 AM
By: Josh Liberatore, Editor, Athletech News
Originally published in the ‘Technology and Innovation 2023 Report’ by Athletech News
Some of the world’s biggest gym chains are leaving revenue on the table, according to Club OS, a sales engagement and marketing automation software provider whose clients include top brands like Anytime Fitness, Gold’s Gym and Retro Fitness.
Club OS helps gyms with standard member acquisition, engagement and retention tasks like automated text message and email follow-ups for members and potential members. But the company’s software can go deeper than that, helping clubs increase the amount of revenue they generate per member by using tools like upselling and strategic giveaways.
Nick Hahn, Vice President of Product and Development at Club OS, spoke with Athletech News about how gyms can do more to leverage their tech stack into more revenue.
Use Software To Offer More Value
First and foremost, Hahn says gyms should be taking advantage of tried-and-true methods of increasing per-member revenue, like upselling on personal training classes.
Club OS’ software allows gyms to track which members used to book personal training sessions at a high clip but have fallen off in recent months or weeks. Gyms can send automated or manual texts, emails or phone calls to encourage those members to resume one-on-one coaching.
“The incremental revenue for personal training is great, so it's a high-priority way to re-engage with the member,” Hahn says.
But there are more under-the-radar ways gyms should be using the software Club OS provides to monetize their members, like upselling on nutrition products, Hahn says.
“Many of our customers are really diving into nutritional supplements as another source of income because it's quite easy,” Hahn says.
Gyms that sell things like protein shakes, smoothies and supplements can use Club OS to track when a member’s monthly supply may be running out, for example.
“If you sell protein powder, and you know the customer has a 30-day supply, 25 days after they purchase it, you should be sending that person an email saying ‘Hey, you're about to run out soon. Why don't you come back in and buy that?’ If a week goes by and they still haven't bought it, give them $1 off or some kind of incentive to come in and purchase it instead of having them go buy it off Amazon,” Hahn explains.
Gyms that sell shakes and smoothies can also offer members free drinks after taking classes that are already included in their membership.
“Offer that to all your members and try to get them hooked into the association of, ‘I take a class I buy a shake,’” Hahn counsels. “An $8 smoothie may only cost 50 cents to make, so you're really increasing the ROI of that class.”
“If you sell protein powder, and you know the customer has a 30-day supply, 25 days after they purchase it, you should be sending that person an email saying ‘Hey, you're about to run out soon. Why don't you come back in and buy that?’”
Nick Hahn, VP/Product & Development, Club OS
Go After ‘Sleeping Members’
Gyms shouldn’t be afraid of reaching out to their “sleeping members,” or those customers who still maintain an active membership and pay monthly dues but rarely if ever step foot in the gym.
“Generally speaking, a lot of gyms are scared to communicate with the sleeping member because they're relying on that passive income,” Hahn says. “But I think there's a real opportunity to turn that passive income into active income, at a higher ROI, by increasing the value for those members.”
Most people who really wanted to get rid of their gym membership likely already did so during the pandemic, Hahn notes.
“If they didn't cancel during COVID, an email now is not going to do it,” he says. “Gyms who are brave enough to try it are not seeing mass cancellations.”
Gyms can use tools like personal training sessions, free classes and discounts on nutrition items, among other tactics, to engage sleeping members.
“The best member is the engaged member,” Hahn says. “Applying technology to engage with an inactive membership base is a big opportunity.”
“Generally speaking, a lot of gyms are scared to communicate with the sleeping member because they're relying on that passive income. But I think there's a real opportunity to turn that passive income into active income, at a higher ROI, by increasing the value for those members.”
Nick Hahn, Club OS
Talk With Your Tech People
Despite the prevalence of software in the fitness industry, many gyms, even large chains, likely aren’t fully leveraging the different technologies they pay for.
“There aren’t many clubs out there that are truly taking advantage of all the functionality that their technology offers,” Hahn believes. “And that's not just Club OS, it's really their entire tech stack. What I find very often in talking with clubs is that they have these ideas of how to do something and they're out there looking for a solution, and one of their existing vendors already solves it, but they're not having the right conversations with them.”
Gym operators are understandably focused on day-to-day operations, but they would do well to carve out some time for regular, strategic conversations with their technology providers, who can serve as valuable business partners.
“Too many view spending an hour a month with each technology vendor as a waste of their time because they need to be in the club operating,” Hahn says. “But gyms should be keeping in touch with their vendors, asking them questions like, ‘What are my competitors doing better in your system that I'm not doing? What features of yours am I not implementing? What can my staff be doing better?”
Even gyms that have been on the cutting edge of the digital revolution risk becoming outdated if they don’t make it a priority to maximize their tech and stay current on new features, enhancements and best practices.
“Technology advances very rapidly and you have to be willing to invest the time into keeping pace with it, or else you’re going to fall behind your competitors,” Hahn says.

[Video] How mActivity uses Social Events to Drive Retention & Increase Engagement from their Gym Members
Posted by
Club OS
on Dec 19, 2023 1:15:15 AM
Watch the full video session with Sarah Pellegrino, Burch Valldejuli (Partner, mActivity) and Nick Hahn (VP of Product, Club
OS).
A gym is nothing without its member community so your members must be highly engaged and motivated. They must also have a positive gym experience to foster long-term loyalty and increase your staff and member retention rates.
One key factor in gym membership retention strategies is fostering a sense of belonging and value among members.
When individuals feel like they are part of a community and perceive tangible benefits from their membership, they are more likely to remain loyal to your club.
Therefore, members must perceive your gym as more than just a place to work out. Your gym business must offer opportunities for your members to come together as a community and build meaningful personal relationships.
And what checks all of those boxes? Member social events!
In the following article, we'll dive into how
mActivity, a health club centered around fostering their members’ physical, social, and mental wellbeing
, leveraged member social events to engage their members and dramatically increase gym member retention.
Let's jump in!
Why is there such a high demand for social events at fitness clubs and who do they benefit most?
As we explored in the last episode of this video series,
How to Grow Your Gym with Gen Z Influencer Marketing
, Gen Z has rapidly become a key market for the gym industry with
nearly half of
all new memberships at the World Gym Texas City and Houston locations being a part of this generation.
We've seen a number of gyms dramatically altering their approach to attracting, engaging and retaining their younger membership demographics based on their members' lifestyles, psychological profiles and fitness goals.
After all, if you're not adapting your marketing and business strategies to align with your key membership demographics, your gym is likely to get left behind.
Looking at the Gen Z and Millennial age groups specifically, it's unsurprising to learn that the effects of the so-called ""Loneliness Epidemic"" are being felt most strongly in these age groups, with
70% of 15-25 year olds having less social interaction with their friends
compared with 20 years ago.
With the lingering effects of the COVID pandemic, widespread adoption of remote working practices and substitution of social media platforms for real-world social interactions, it might be easier than ever to for the younger generations to connect online, but it's not necessarily better for them, and we see this reflected in the statistics.
According to the
American Psychological Association (APA
), 70% of individuals in the older generations report having “very good"" or ""excellent” mental health, contrasted with only 56% of Millennials and a mere 45% of Gen Z.
More worrying still are trends amongst teenage girls in the U.S.;
in 2011, 37% of teenage girls reported ""persistent feelings of sadness"" which has increased to just under 60% in just a decade
.
This latter statistic was particularly troubling for Burch Valldejuli (Partner, mActivity), whose background in psychiatric research at Harvard led her into developing a state-of-the-art fitness facility, with a strong focus on providing her members with the tools they needed for both physical and mental health.
Located in the vibrant college-town community of New Haven, Connecticut and with 62% of mActivity's membership base being female--thus more statistically likely to suffer from poorer mental health--Burch was keen to develop a safe space for her members to work out.
She was determined to remove the intimidation factor associated with gym training, so ensured that she optimized the layout of her gym to encourage social networking and embody an inclusive, accepting environment for members of any fitness level and body type.
Like many clubs, mActivity found that member socials have proved enormously successful in uniting their gym community, providing a key value proposition which both attracts more Gen Z and Millennial members and provides a cornerstone to increase gym membership retention.
How do member social events benefit your gym and staff?
Member social events are one of the best gym member retention ideas you can implement because they benefit your staff as well as your gym member community.
Your member socials are a great way to spotlight and celebrate your dedicated staff working behind the scenes, providing an essential platform for your employees to support and interact with members on a more personal level.
Providing a relaxed setting outside of the typical member/staff dynamic can be a great way to break the ice and foster deeper relationships that improve the member and staff experience.
Ultimately, the positive atmosphere created by social events boosts morale and job satisfaction, leading to improved staff retention rates and a better customer service experience.
From a revenue growth perspective, member social events lead to happier members which leads to dividends toward your bottom line.
An impressive example of this is when mActivity
raised their membership prices for the first time in four years by almost 50%, and maintained a 2% churn rate.
How did they accomplish this incredible feat?
Transparency. Burch and her team leveraged the tight-knit community they built and simply explained to their members that the higher rates would enable them to pay (and keep!) their staff. mActivity’s members were actively in favor of paying higher fees in order to maintain the high-quality, personable service that they had come to expect – and love – from their gym.
By demonstrating to their members how the increased fees would contribute back into the culture and community that they valued so highly,
mActivity was able to retain 98% of their membership base
, reduce staff turnover, generate significant revenue, and invest in maintaining their industry-leading level of service.
What are the benefits of social events for your gym members?
As we've seen, integrating member socials into your gym's calendar isn't just about creating a fun diversion; it's as much a strategic business plan that can provide numerous win-win benefits for your members.
Beyond the benefits of physical exercise, providing inclusive member socials are a great way to increase member engagement and foster friendships amongst your members who might not otherwise have a chance to connect between sets or chat with each other on the treadmill.
Indeed, mActivity find that
13% of their members engage with their social events,
giving them the opportunity to engage with a significant chunk of their membership base in a single space and help to create a cohesive community feel amongst members of diverse backgrounds, fitness levels and psychological profiles.
With increased social connections, members are also more likely to rank higher in terms of customer satisfaction and reap the psychological benefits that come with becoming a more active social member within your gym.
After all, by helping your members invest in their mental health as well as their physical health, you'll provide a holistic framework for wellbeing that provides enormous value for your members.
How to plan your member socials: a mActivity Case Study
When running your social events, there are a number of different factors you'll want to consider in order to create an enjoyable and beneficial member experience.
To start planning your events, you might want to consider things like:
who
you want to target
, what
type of event or theme you want to run with,
where
you want to hold your event and
when
is best time to host your event to maximize member engagement.
We've pulled out some of the best
examples from mActivity's event strategy to give you some inspiration for your own member socials:
Who your member socials should target
In terms of your target audience, you should consider the fact that not all of your members have the same interests or goals, so make sure that your events offer enough diversity to attract different members through your doors.
mActivity found that attendance generally ranged between 80-120 people and opened their doors to friends and family in order to make their events more inclusive and generate more warm referrals.
Picking your event theme
When it comes to theming, asking your staff members can be a great way to engage your employees and gain valuable insights from the people closest to your members.
mActivity successfully implemented this strategy to give a sense of ownership to their staff members, who opted for themes like ""prom"" and a ""fashion show"", even collaborating with a DJ who was a member of the gym for maximum inclusivity.
Selecting the best time to host your member social
In terms of timings, consider when is a convenient time for your members, as well as what might lead to the most profitability for your gym.
mActivity looked closely at their member behavior to decide on the first Thursday of each month, avoiding the busy weekends and capitalizing on a day that was typically slower in terms of foot traffic on the gym floor, for example.
Where to hold your event
Finally, make sure that the location of your social event accounts for weather conditions, licensing laws and optimizes the space available; after all, running an outdoor event is almost certain to be more popular in the summer than mid-December.
When considering space, mActivity knew that their large front-of-house lent itself perfectly to the intimate and comfortable atmosphere they wanted to generate for their members, so using a communal space that doesn't leave your members ducking under barbells is likely to create a more pleasant social experience.

How Our Scheduler Helps Gyms & Members
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:35:17 PM
When it comes to running a gym or fitness club, happy members are obviously top priority and key to healthy retention. You may think that the technical side of running a business is only helpful to you as a gym owner, but members appreciate intuitive and up to date software that benefits their fitness journeys and gym experiences–especially when it comes to personal training and group classes. Here is how
our scheduler
helps both gyms and members.
ORGANIZES YOUR CLUB
Organization is crucial to any successful business, especially a gym because fitness success stories derive from people having plans and structures. Our scheduler displays day, month and year views on a clean and modern interface that makes navigation quick and easy, using our robust drag and drop. With this feature, an owner is able to sign a member up for an event in a calendar view by quickly dragging a class or personal training session right under their profile. Our scheduler also offers features like room design and conflict resolution, which go hand in hand when it comes to knowing what is where and when events are happening.
The room design feature allows owners to label where all classes and trainers will be on a given day, while our conflict resolution solves any scheduling issues before they arise. Both features will verify whether an event has been double-booked or is in the wrong area of room. Plus, personal trainers feel taken care of with these features because they don’t have to worry about making sure their trainees are in the correct area at the right time. Lastly, our scheduler will send out email notifications to all sides of the party–class instructors, trainers and members to notify everyone where they’re supposed to be at what specific times, ensuring there is no miscommunication, and everyone is on the same page.

How Our Mobile App Generates Club Revenue
EFFICIENT FOR MEMBERS
Members need efficiency with their fitness goals and appreciate being able to quickly sign up for personal training or group classes right from their phones. This ultimately adds value to their fitness experiences and an owner’s retention because members don’t have to jump through hoops to use all that a gym has to offer. Besides, if a gym or fitness club does not offer these tools that members need to be successful, retention will go down and members will seek them elsewhere.
It’s all about understanding people, then implementing that intuition into the software. Sometimes members, especially individuals who are new to working out, don’t even fully know what they need and want. Their deciding factor of signing up for a gym membership in the first place may not have necessarily been the software. They also most likely didn’t even know from the get-go that technology would help their success, but it will sure keep someone around in the long run because they feel like they are being taken care of.
Members sign up for group classes and personal training for a reason, ­and it’s usually because they need the extra motivation and a typical gym session just won’t cut it. On a deeper level, members need other people to relate to and connect with, and fitness, whether it’s a spin class or one-on-one training, is as personal as it gets from a business standpoint. When technology covers the extra work, screen time is reduced, and face to face time is increased.
ULTIMATELY BUILDS COMMUNITY
In this day and age when technology dictates every waking moment, establishing strong bonds with all gym members is imperative to healthy and successful gyms. The point is for the technology to take care of the owners, so they can take care of their members. Even though many would argue that technology retracts us from authentic human interaction, it’s actually the opposite with our scheduler.
The more intuitive and efficient technology is, the less time a client spends looking at a computer screen and worrying about running their business, which means they have more quality time to connect with their members, enjoy club activities with them and help them reach their fitness goals. As this happens, the retention of a fitness club will naturally increase because the technology takes care of the rest.

How to Close the Sale on a Prospective Gym Member
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:38:51 PM
Nurturing gym member leads is all well and good, but if you can’t seal the deal at the end of the day, the work you’ve done doesn’t really matter. When you’re trying to get prospects to commit to a membership, you’re pretty much a salesperson trying to close the sale. If you can master every part of the sales process, then you can convert more leads, boost member acquisition, and increase your revenue.
In this article, we’ll go over the essential points of closing a sale, so you can keep your numbers moving in all the right directions.
Start with a Good First Impression
On average,
it takes seven seconds to make a first impression
. Starting off on the right foot with your prospects will make the sales process much easier, as they’ll be more likely to trust you.
Work with your team to teach them how to initiate communication with prospects, whether through email, texting, or phone calls. Then, make sure you and your staff are greeting members, prospects, and anyone who walks into your gym enthusiastically. Making prospects feel welcome from the second they walk in your door can go a long way when trying to make a sale.
Top Tip:
Use
these fitness sales scripts
from Club OS to train your team on interacting with prospects during each segment of the sales process!
Get to Know Their Pain Points
Customer pain points are problems they have for which they’re still looking for a product or service to provide a solution. Homing in on these unmet needs will allow you to position your services as that solution. It will also show the prospect that you care about their needs, goals, and story, and not just making a sale. In fact,
buyers report
that listening to their needs is the number one thing a sales rep can do to make their experience positive.
The easiest way to uncover a prospect’s pain points is to ask them. Ask questions like “Why did you come in today?” and “What do you hope to achieve by joining a gym?” You may find their concerns revolve more around pricing, available equipment, types of classes, or having trouble reaching their fitness goals. Use this information to tailor your sales pitch as the solution they’ve been searching for.
Address Their Concerns
It’s natural that some prospects may still have lingering concerns throughout the sales process. Instead of hoping you hit on them, ask if they still have any objections to joining after you’ve made your pitch and, if they do, what those objections are. If they share concerns, address them directly.
Many prospects share the same concerns about joining a gym — membership prices, failed attempts at past fitness goals, no time in their schedule, lack of motivation or
accountability
, and so on. Preparing your team to alleviate these common concerns during the sales process ahead of time can help them do so more effectively.
Create a Sense of Urgency
If a prospect leaves without signing up for a gym membership, your chances of converting them go way down. One common and effective sales tactic for preventing this is to create a sense of urgency. Make your prospect feel as if they have to commit
now
or they’ll miss out on something.
The easiest way to create urgency during the sales process is with a time-sensitive promo. If one of your personal trainers is
trying to close a sale on a package
, for example, they could offer the prospect two additional free sessions for signing up right then and there. To create urgency without a promo, take an emotional angle with your pitch. Use what you’ve learned about their pain points to convince them that they need to act now to reach their fitness goals.
Be Direct
At the end of the day, both you and the prospect know you’re trying to close the deal. Don’t be pushy about it, but at some point, ask for the sale directly. Remember though — the way you ask matters. Make signing up for your gym and any other services you’ve discussed feel like a solution that has been tailor-made for them, not a generic plea for a sale.
Convert More Leads with ASF and Club OS
Making the sales and onboarding process as easy as possible for your team and your prospects will translate to increased member acquisition. ASF can make it easier than ever for prospects to join your club with
online signup
and a
flexible offer builder
to add urgency with limited-time discounts. But if you want to take the sales automation and engagement process a step further, our
Club OS software integration
will close any remaining gaps.

How To Eat Healthy at Restaurants
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:35:06 PM
Whether you’re eating out on a Friday night or you don’t feel like cooking on a Tuesday evening, dining out is a part of life. Unfortunately, it can also lead to weight gain and conflict with fitness goals, especially when we aren’t in control of what goes into the foods that are prepared for us. There’s no shame in treating yourself once in a while and cooking your own meals majority of the time. In fact, practicing realistic habits is a healthier way of life because you’re still enjoying the foods you love in moderation, but not letting them counteract your fitness goals.
Moderation becomes difficult to achieve when cheat meals turn into cheat days because so many of us think, “well I already ate a bite of that so might as well eat the whole thing.” Although sometimes it’s perfectly fine to order the huge plate of pasta, there’s a healthier way to enjoy life and avoid the guilt that comes along with eating out. Here are some guidelines to follow for your next trip to a restaurant.

13 Common Weight Loss Mistakes
Here’s How to Eat Healthy at Restaurants
DRINK WATER OR UNSWEETENED ICED TEA
This sounds like a no-brainer, but water actually helps keep you fuller longer and can prevent overeating. What you want to drink is the first question your server will ask you, so ditch the soda (yes diet soda too) and order a water with lemon or an unsweetened iced tea with lemon. Both are guilt-free and zero-calorie options.
IF YOU’RE ORDERING ALCOHOL
Now it’s no secret that alcohol is probably your worst enemy if you’re trying to lose weight or are focused on fitness, but we’re human and living a healthy lifestyle is about moderation, not restriction. An effective rule of thumb to follow is to avoid any caramel-colored liquors like whiskey, blended mixed drinks and heavy beers. These are packed with tons of sugar, and one drink alone can contain up to 300 calories. So, if it’s a Friday night and you order a few of these, you can imagine that’s not a very pretty math equation. Try to order just one drink and stick to a glass of red wine that has about 150 calories or a vodka soda with about 70 calories.
LOOK FOR THE “LIGHTER” SECTION
You initially might think that this section on a menu sucks the fun and flavor out of your meal, but these dishes are typically just as delicious and are half the calories of what you normally would order. They also help with practicing portion control. How many times have you gone to an Italian restaurant and can’t finish the whole plate of pasta? That’s because restaurants over-compensate portion sizes and your body actually does not need those extra calories. Order off the lighter menu if the restaurant offers it, get a friendlier portion and you’ll most likely be just as satisfied, if not more.
START WITH A SALAD OR SOUP
Get in the habit of “spoiling your appetite” by ordering broth-based soup or a salad with non-creamy dressing on the side before diving into the actual entrée. One of the biggest culprits for weight gain is portion control. It’s not necessarily that you ordered the fettucine alfredo, it’s that you ate too much of it in one sitting and your body can’t digest it properly, so it just gets stored as fat. Plus, we tend to eat whatever is put in front of us and are taught to eat until our plates are clean.
These are dangerous things when dining out considering an average plate of food at a restaurant adds up to about 1500 calories. By starting with soup or a salad before the entrée comes, you’re more likely to eat less of the entrée, but feel just as satisfied.
Avoid making the common mistake of ordering salads with dressings like ranch and blue cheese and avoid cream-based soups. Just because you’re eating a salad or a small bowl of soup does not make it healthier. Most of the cream-based options are packed with fat and equate to a full meal’s worth of calories. By making easy swaps, food still tastes good and your waistline will thank you for it.
LOOK FOR KEYWORDS AND CALORIE COUNTS ON MENUS
This applies to those pesky hidden ingredients in fine print that usually double the calories and fat of an entrée. For example, if you’re looking at the salad section of a menu, most people make the mistake of ordering something because it
seems
healthy, when a lot of the time, many big salads are loaded with cheese, fried chicken and bacon bits and are topped with creamy dressings that make it even worse for you–so when you think you’re ordering something innocent, it’s actually the same number of calories as a cheeseburger, if not more.
The way to avoid this is to scan the menu descriptions for words like “fried” or “cream.” Also look for good words like “grilled” and “steamed.” If you’re eyeing something that is fried or contains a lot of cheese, simply request your chicken to be grilled instead of fried and ask for no cheese. Restaurants are meant to make these accommodations for people, and no­, you aren’t bothering your server or being high maintenance because you requested your food a certain way. You’re paying for it, so you might as well enjoy yourself without the guilt.
Most restaurants nowadays are required to include calorie counts in their menus. Although the goal is not to become obsessed with numbers, the calorie counts are usually a good reference to use when deciding what you’re going to order, but avoid relying on these numbers, as some of them are not as accurate as you might think. Rely on yourself to make the executive decision by being smart about the actual ingredients in the food.
ORDER A HALF PORTION OR SHARE WITH SOMEONE
When you’re starving at a restaurant, your eyes tend to be bigger than your stomach and you think you’re hungrier than you actually are. Plus, good-smelling food that is bursting with flavor doesn’t always help with accurate hunger cues. No matter what dish you’re ordering, try sharing with someone or ordering a half portion.
This way if it’s something that is higher in calories and fat, you’re literally cutting those numbers in half, but you’re still allowing yourself to enjoy the dish, and you’ll most likely still feel full and but not over-stuff yourself. The bill will also look a lot nicer to you because you’ll only be paying for one entrée instead of two. It’s a win-win.
EAT SLOWLY AND FOLLOW THE 5-SECOND RULE
We know that when your dish arrives to your table you’re probably ready to scarf it down. Sit back, take a bite and really be in the moment. By eating slower and actually focusing on the eating aspect, you’re allowing your body to respond to what’s being put in it, giving your brain time to decide when you’re full.
Five seconds is about the amount of time you want to take between each bite. This definitely will feel weird, controlling and unnatural at first, but if you practice it a few times when you go out, eventually, you will naturally adapt to something similar, and will see results from all of your time at the gym because you’re burning more calories than you’re taking in.
MINIMIZE ON DESSERT
Dessert at restaurants is usually best to avoid all together if you’re trying to watch what you eat, but if you’re that person who has a major sweet tooth, take a couple bites of chocolate cake and then be done. When it comes to anything that we crave, especially sweets, our brains don’t need the whole brownie to be satisfied–just a bite or two. Or instead of indulging in the ice cream and cake, order a coffee with a little cream.
FOR TYPES OF CUISINES
Some restaurants don’t have a “lighter section” on their menus. If this is the case, here are some healthier examples of what you could order:
–
AMERICAN FOOD
Order a burger with no bun, load up the burger with vegetables, instead of French fries, order a side salad or fruit, and instead of mayonnaise, use mustard.
–
ITALIAN FOOD
Order pastas with tomato-based sauces. For example, spaghetti with meatballs isn’t necessarily “healthy,” but it’s a better choice than fettucine alfredo. For pizza, order a side salad to start and then order thin crust pizza with veggies. You’ll still satisfy your pizza craving, but the calories will be a lot kinder to you.
–
MEXICAN FOOD
Mexican food tends to be a little more difficult considering everything is mostly deep fried. Luckily, there are still ways around the system. If you’re absolutely craving enchiladas, cut the calories in half by sharing with someone. For an even healthier option that is also filling, order a “taco” salad with chicken, lots of lettuce and guacamole. Ditch the cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips, but load it up with salsa.
–
ASIAN FOOD
Since Chinese food is mostly all deep fried and packed with salt and sugar, order a small soup to curb your appetite and try ordering your entrée steamed. If you’re at a sushi restaurant, cut back on the rice by ordering low-carb cucumber sushi. The cucumber replaces the rice, but you still get the sushi taste. Although plain steamed rice isn’t necessarily bad for you, try ordering brown rice instead with more nutrients.

How to Engage and Retain Gym Members During the Holidays
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:35:00 PM
To say the holidays are a hectic time would be an understatement for most. Between digging out the decorations, prepping for celebrations, shopping for gifts, and traveling to see or hosting family, there’s not much time left for self-care. For gym-goers, this often means falling off track with their exercise routine as other distractions and obligations take precedence.
As a fitness club owner, you’re likely to see the chaos of this season reflected in decreased member attendance and engagement. If you want to keep your clients active, you’ll have to increase your efforts to motivate and entice them.
In this article, you’ll learn more about how to capitalize on current fitness trends to add value to your memberships, incentivize clients, and boost gym member retention through the holidays and beyond.
The Bottom Line Today: A Look at the Impact of the Pandemic on the Fitness Industry
It would be impossible to conceive or implement any truly effective strategies for engaging members of your gym without considering how the pandemic has affected the fitness world. COVID-19 has shifted the needs, preferences, priorities, and goals of your clientele — here’s how:
A holistic approach to health
Mental, emotional, and spiritual fitness is just as important as physical fitness to much of post-pandemic society. One of the top motivators for exercising today, identified by 35% of consumers surveyed in a
recent IHRSA report
, was mental well-being. We can see this reflected in the rise in popularity of activities like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness exercises.
At-home workouts
Gym members are still loving the comfort, convenience, and safety of virtual fitness options. Those who are not yet comfortable returning to in-person facilities are making use of free online workouts, on-demand programs, livestreamed classes, and fitness apps.
Class-focused clubs
Boutique clubs that offer class-based workouts make people feel safer. The controlled class sizes and block scheduling limit potential virus exposure and gives clubs time to thoroughly sanitize between each group.
More interest in fitness
The imminent threat of COVID-19 — especially to those with largely preventable underlying conditions like obesity and cardiovascular disease — has highlighted the importance of taking care of our bodies. RunRepeat’s study of how the coronavirus has changed people’s fitness routines revealed an
88% increase in exercise
for those who normally exercise only 1-2 times per week.
How to Add Value to Your Gym Memberships
By last April,
34% of gym exercisers
had either canceled or planned on cancelling their memberships. After months of closures and millions of cancellations, many gyms have reached a point where they need to increase membership costs. Although this is completely understandable from a business standpoint, current and new potential members will not be happy. So, what is a gym simply trying to stay afloat to do?
Especially with the holidays coming up — a time when many clients may consider cancelling their membership to soften the financial blow from the holidays — it is imperative that your members feel the
value
of your membership is increasing along with the price point.
Consider these ideas for boosting member retention during a holiday price increase:
1.
Personalize the member experience.
Reach out to members to discuss goals, provide fitness assessments, give personalized recommendations, and check in with their progress throughout their journey.
2.
Expand your services.
Give clients more bang for their buck with new classes, updated equipment, wellness and recovery services (nutritionists, massage, stretching area, mental health resources), weight loss programs, accountability coaching, and livestream or on-demand options.
3.
Use Point of Sale to your advantage.
Invest in
state-of-the-art POS software
, so your team can easily supplement services with merchandise your members will find valuable. (
Here’s some more info
about increasing revenue and enhancing your member experience using point of sale.)
4.
Simplify membership management with a mobile app.
The less work your members have to do to arrange the details for their workout, the more value they’ll attribute to your services. Make it easy for members to view schedules, book sessions, check into the club, make payments, and access their member profile with a
killer mobile app
.
6 Ways to Incentivize Gym Members to Boost Retention through the Holiday Season
The onset of the holidays is a great time to revamp your efforts to engage with members and motivate them to stick to their goals. Here are a few ways you can kickstart your holiday fitness marketing campaign:
1.) Hold a competition.
The drive to win a prize (or even just ultimate bragging rights) can be a great motivator for your holiday-fatigued gym members. Run challenges throughout November and December that get people moving. Don’t forget to include at-home options to engage those who are too busy to stop in or still hesitant to return.
Try it:
Each time someone checks in to the gym, they earn a set number of points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the month gets a $100 gift card to your retail store.
2.) Create a rewards program.
Loyalty programs are great automated tools for ongoing engagement. Create a special rewards system for the holiday season or, if you don’t have a program yet, time your launch for early November to make those forthcoming Black Friday deals even more enticing.
Try it:
For every 10 group classes a member takes, they get their next class (or two—come on, it’s the season of giving!) free.
3.) Host a holiday event.
For many members, the social aspect of going to the gym is just as important as the fitness component. Plan an event to celebrate the holidays, such as a themed class, after-hours party, family fun night, or a holiday tournament.
Try it:
Have a holiday happy hour after your most popular spin class time slot to encourage members to mingle with staff and each other. Pepper favorite holiday carols throughout the playlist, deck out the studio in Christmas lights, and serve seasonal cocktails when class is over.
4.) Offer daily or weekly discounts.
When you offer a different deal every day or week, members will have no choice but to check back with your socials or at the club to see what’s next. Create a discount campaign that follows a fun holiday theme, like the 12 days of Christmas or 8 days of Hanukkah.
Try it:
On the first day of Christmas my gym gave to me…a pass to bring a brand-new friend free!
5.) Provide at-home fitness resources.
Again, with everybody’s busy schedules and lingering Covid fears, getting some members into the gym in the next few months is going to be a tough sell. Keep these members engaged now with virtual workout options, such as livestreamed classes, prerecorded trainer-led workouts, or written programs, so they remember you when their schedules calm down and New Year’s resolution time comes around.
Try it:
Email members a half-hour workout video once a week that they can do at home without equipment. Ask them to post a sweaty selfie or screenshot of their workout stats to their social media when they’re done (and tag you!) in exchange for next week’s class.
6.) Keep the content flowing.
It’s especially important during this busy time to maintain a strong online presence. Even if they’re not hitting the gym as often, your members won’t slow down on checking their phones. Stay active on social media and in direct contact with members via email campaigns with fitness tips, healthy holiday recipes, and so forth.
Try it:
Post a #FitFamFriday every week on Instagram that features a photo and short bio of an employee or loyal member.

[Video] How to Grow Your Gym with Gen Z Influencer Marketing
Posted by
Club OS
on Nov 7, 2023 4:02:44 PM
Watch the full
Making Your Members Your Influencers
on-demand webinar.
It's no secret that the fitness industry is ever-evolving. One trend that has evolved (and has proven it's here to stay) is the emergence of Gen Z as a significant market segment that can make or break a gym's success.
Adapting your approach to appeal to this tech-savvy and health-conscious generation could be a key tactic to driving profitability and creating an engaged, loyal fitness community with significant long-term revenue opportunities for your gym. In our latest Talk Data To Me webinar, Sarah Pellegrino takes a deep-dive into just that with Nick Hernandez (Senior GM, World Gym Texas City and Houston) and Nick Hahn (VP of Product, Club OS).
In this article, we'll dive into that discussion with them, exploring why Gen Z presents a huge market opportunity for gyms. We'll also take a look at the effective tactics used by World Gym and other Club OS customers in harnessing Gen Z ’s social media prowess to create a loyal following of “micro-influencers” with powerful, user-generated content to catapult your club into social media stardom and
increase brand awareness.
Who Is Gen Z?
Broadly speaking, Generation Z or Gen Z refers to individuals born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s. As of 2023, Gen Z members are between the ages of 13 and 26 years old, encompassing high school students all the way to college students and young working professionals.
Within this group, there are a lot of different motivations and fitness goals that get people to the gym. But one common theme that unites them all—and the most important one to consider when targeting this membership demographic—is digital technology and social media.
Why Is Gen Z a Crucial Target Audience for the Fitness Industry?
So, how does the “digital generation” approach health and fitness? And why are they such an exciting potential market for gym owners to tap into?
According to
Murphy Research
,
70% of Gen Zers are actively engaging with fitness
(wearing a fitness tracker or using a fitness app at least once a week) and a massive
43% of the 60,000 Gen Zers surveyed had a gym membership
.
Indeed, at World Gym,
almost half–46% (Texas City) and 48% (Houston)–of new membership sign-ups are Gen Z
!
The ability to effectively communicate, engage with, and motivate this target market was of paramount importance to World Gym to drive new memberships as well as long-term brand loyalty. Not to mention the added potential of being able to nurture a life-long commitment to fitness within the Gen Z community from a young age.
Why Do
Fitness Influencers Resonate So Well with Gen Z?
Gen Z represents the first post-internet generation that doesn't remember a time that they weren’t online
.
Their lives and social communities are so intertwined with digital technology and social media that they're practically inseparable. In fact, according to a recent study,
almost a quarter would rather give up sex than their mobile phone
.
With the rapidly increasing number of fitness influencers taking to social media platforms like
Instagram
,
YouTube
, and
TikTok
, it's no surprise that Gen Z is already consuming, sharing, and posting fitness-related content on social media. Especially considering that
over 60% of TikTok's 1.7 billion users are of this generation
.
Their social media habits make Gen Z especially receptive to so-called ""gymfluencer"" marketing. Not only are these members engaging with fitness influencer content, but they're also making real purchasing decisions based on influencers. Statistics show that as many as
33% of Gen Z bought a product recommended by an influencer in the last 3 months
.
When you consider these insights into the demographic, it's clear that fitness influencer marketing campaigns are vital for gyms that want to bring in more Gen Z members.
How to Successfully Implement Influencer Marketing Tactics to Target Gen Z
If as many as half of your new members are Gen Z, it’s crucial to understand the psychology behind what drives them, how they prefer to communicate, and
how they behave while they’re at the gym
to fully tap into the potential of this market.
As Nick Hernandez of World Gym goes on to demonstrate, capitalizing on Gen Z’s passion for social media was pivotal to helping them grow their membership. Using social media, World Gym was able to generate warm referrals, increase their brand presence, and create a virtual army of social media micro-influencers.
What's more, many of their new Gen Z members were happy and willing to share their testimonials, create amazing social content, and contribute to a thriving and vibrant fitness community. The best part? By harnessing this user-generated content, you’re effectively letting your members do your marketing for you for free!
If you're going to start to leverage an influencer marketing strategy, it's important to note that the right fitness influencers to make an impact for your gym aren't always those with a massive online following.
For example, engagement rates on TikTok are over
3 X higher for micro-influncers
(sub 100K followers) compared with their macro (100K+ followers) counterparts. That means that Gen Z gym members who are active on social can still make a substantial impression when they share content connected to your fitness brand, even if they're not the next CrossFit fitness celebrity or sponsored by Gymshark.
How World Gym Turned Their Gen Z Gym Members Into Fitness Influencers
As we've established, almost half of Gen Zers are active gym users, social media savvy, and highly receptive to influencer marketing.
But how can you use these insights
to target and attract Gen Z members, ultimately leading to revenue growth, increased social media engagement, and a firm foothold in your local market?
In the following section, we'll cover our top tips around how to build an influencer marketing strategy using World Gym as a key example of how to do it right. Before you know it, you'll have your own fitness influencer marketing agency right within your own community.
4 Steps to Creating a Win-Win Partnership with Gen Z to Influence New Membership Sales
Tap into Gen Z's motivations and encourage friendly competition.
World Gym Texas City & Houston found that their Gen Z members often preferred working out as a social group. They also enjoyed friendly competition and were more motivated when they were ""hyped up"" in a high-energy atmosphere to express themselves among their peers.
To infuse that excitement into their Gen Z members' workout experience, World Gym had coaches from their Athletics Program come out onto the gym floor to hype them up. Their team focused on mimicking the high school or college environment that most of these members were used to in an effort to motivate, engage, and keep them coming back for more.
By appealing to their social competitiveness, World Gym was able to create warm referrals via attracting and converting any non-members within their Gen Z members' social circles.
After all, if you see your friend getting all the social media glory for bench pressing a measly 150lbs, why wouldn't you sign up to the same gym to prove to the world that you can out-lift them?
Create in-house social media content directly from the gym floor.
World Gym started developing their influencer marketing platform by having their Marketing Director out on the gym floor shooting video footage of their members (with consent!).
The content ranged from Gen Z members working out to video testimonials about what their members loved about their gym experience. They even asked members about their go-to music or playlist for getting pumped up for a workout (with the option to play it on the gym's own sound system).
Not only would this footage prove to be gold when shared on social media, but by playing their members' music in the gym and featuring their workout videos on their Jumbotron and TV screens around the gym floor, World Gym was able to create a fully immersive and community-led atmosphere. This helped them generate high engagement and demonstrate that they were committed to building their fitness brands around their members.
For members who were reluctant to post their own videos, World Gym created a collaborative environment by encouraging their members to send across raw video footage. They shared their Marketing Director's direct contact information or had members send footage as a direct message, and then had the footage professionally edited and posted it on World Gym's corporate account.
Using this technique, World Gym created high-quality video testimonials which portrayed their members as fitness micro-influencers, all the while creating a mountain of killer content to use as marketing material on social media.
Leverage user-generated content across multiple social media platforms.
Sharing user-generated content (i.e. content created by your gym members) is a fantastic way to both spotlight your members and to create free marketing content to promote your gym.
According to a recent study,
84% of Gen Z tend to trust brands who use real customers in their ads
. So, using authentic user-generated content as social proof also helps to build trust with your Gen Z prospects and makes it easier to convert them into paying members.
World Gym created a successful influencer marketing campaign by encouraging their members to share their gym footage across multiple channels, like TikTok and Instagram, and re-posting the videos via World Gym's corporate account.
This meant that their Gen Z members were not only promoting World Gym to their own social networks and followings as micro-influencers, but also creating free marketing content for them to repurpose for their own marketing campaigns.
Incentivize your members to share their gym wins, experiences, and training routines on social media.
When it comes to encouraging your Gen Z members to post their gym content on social platforms, consider offering an incentive.
For instance, you can run contests or merchandise giveaways to reward members who spotlight your gym on their profiles. Or featuring their contributions on your official gym or studio accounts to amplify their voices is another great way to offer a win-win incentive.
World Gym, for example, asked their members to show their biggest flex, share images from their designated ""Posing Room,"" and tag them on their workout routines to receive a ""shoutout"" through World Gym's official social media account. By doing so, they offered their members the opportunity to boost their own followings and engagement on social media, helping to propel the next generation of athletes and fitness stars into social media fame.

How to Help Gym Members with Accountability
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:36:09 PM
Accountability and fitness go together like blender bottles and protein powder. When people join your gym, they’re looking for a place where they can confidently achieve their fitness goals — with plenty of support in tow.
So how can you help gym members with accountability? Merriam-Webster defines accountability as “an obligation or willingness to accept responsibility or to account for one’s actions.” Whereas some of your members want to come in, workout, and never speak to another human being about their goals or workout, other members will need more support and guidance — they
just
might not verbalize it.
But we’ve got your back. This article has strategies that can help your gym encourage members to take responsibility for their health and achieve their fitness goals faster.
Get to Know What Motivates Your Members
The more you understand about who your members are, the more you can cater your accountability strategies to what they need and want. Consider adding the following questions to your onboarding questionnaire:
What is your “why” for your fitness journey?
What motivates you to achieve your goals?
What are your hobbies? What do you do in your spare time?
What does success look like at the gym, at home, and/or work?
When you achieve a goal, how do you like to celebrate?
Understanding what motivates your gym members can give you powerful tools for motivating them and helping them achieve accountability and consistency.
Check In to Keep Members on Track
It’s not necessary to check in with every member every day, but the more you can catch up with your members, the more you’ll understand their goals and challenges so you can help them with accountability and consistency.
One way to gain insight into your members’ behaviors and goals is to use a member app that offers
habit tracking
. Then, you can ping members with in-app messages celebrating consistent tracking or reminding them about habit goals. If you don’t offer a member app, you can automate emails or texts that can be just as effective as in-app messages and notifications.
Celebrate Member Wins and Progress
You’d be surprised how many of your club’s members are sharing images and posts about their workouts and progress on social media. This type of content is called user-generated content (UGC), and it’s a powerful way to celebrate your members while also showing potential members what they could accomplish at your gym.
If a member tags your club in their Instagram Story, reshare it to your own stories. If they mention you in a public Facebook post, comment on it. If you notice a member hasn’t been to the gym or attended a class in a while, you can hop on social media and engage with their content so your gym and their fitness goals stay top of mind.
When you show an interest in what your members are doing at your club and encourage them in a public forum, they’re more likely to stick to their goals and keep coming in too. Why? Because they see that your gym is as invested in their fitness journey as they are!
Offer Incentives to Stay on Track
To help members with accountability, it’s important to get to know your clients. What are their interests and passions? Let’s say Steve, a fan of mindfulness, used to come into your gym five times per week. You look in your
member management system
and see that Steve is now only working out once per week. You might reach out to Steve via text or email:
“Hey Steve! We used to see you every M-F, and we miss you! To get you back in and on track, we’ll give you a free
gift card for one month of Headspace
if we see you five days per week over the next 30 days.”
Think about this strategy as creating a personal challenge for your members to keep them accountable and moving toward their goals. Here are other things you can use to incentivize members to reach goals, get back on track, and stay accountable:
Gift card to a nearby coffee shop or smoothie shack
Branded merchandise, such as T-shirts or hoodies
Discount on personal training sessions or group classes
Motivational or fitness-related books
Encourage Members to Find an Accountability Partner
One study
found that people who tell another person about their goal had a 65% chance of achieving it and a 95% chance of achieving that goal if they committed to meeting up with that person.
Here are a few ways that you can help your members with accountability:

How to Increase Employee Retention at Your Gym or Fitness Club
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:33:56 PM
Few companies have escaped the impact of what has been dubbed “The Great Resignation” of 2021. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in August of this year alone,
4.3 million Americans
quit their jobs.
Gyms and fitness clubs have found themselves to be no exception to this trend, especially considering the hit the pandemic already delivered to membership levels, profits, and overall operations. The result? Employee retention is more important to the fitness industry now than ever before.
Let’s take a closer look at some of the challenges companies are facing with retention, why reducing turnover is crucial for your business, and how you can keep employees around and happy.
Why Businesses Are Struggling with Employee Retention Today
Many of the underlying causes driving increased employee turnover in 2021 have plagued companies for decades. However, in light of the pandemic, these root issues have become even more substantial and immediate dealbreakers for a larger portion of the workforce.
Here are some of the biggest reasons companies—and gyms and fitness clubs in particular—are seeing increased turnover today:
Disengagement:
Without passion for their work or a connection to their organization, workers lack the motivation to work hard or commit to their employer. Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace report found that on a global scale,
employee engagement decreased
from 22% in 2019 to 20% in 2020.
Poor Rewards & Recognition:
Especially after working through a global pandemic, employees want to feel like a valued part of their companies. Inadequate compensation, insufficient benefits packages, and lack of active recognition for contributions all impair motivation and drive turnover.
Lack of Professional Growth Opportunities:
Workers today want a career in which they can grow their skillsets, advance in pay and position, and be satisfied in their progress. If employees feel their career or abilities are stagnant at their current workplace, with no prospects for forward movement, they have no incentive to stay.
Insufficient Work-Life Balance:
Employee burnout has become an epidemic in its own right. In a study conducted by Indeed in the first half of 2021,
52% of survey participants
reported experiencing burnout this year—compared to 43% of respondents who said the same in a pre-pandemic survey. After the death and devastation wrought by COVID-19, people are no longer willing to sacrifice time spent with loved ones or their own mental health for their employer.
·
Micromanagement:
Managers who constantly check up on their subordinates’ every move are driving them into the arms of companies that offer more autonomy. Micromanaging creates stress and anxiety, as well as often prevents employees from doing their jobs effectively (and enjoyably).
Why Gym and Club Owners Should Care About Employee Retention
Some companies don’t give a second thought to turnover, even now. After all, with so many people unemployed and searching for jobs, you can simply hire someone else to replace employees lost, right?
If that’s how you look at employee retention as a gym or fitness club owner, then that is your first mistake. Employee retention is crucial to your success in the fitness industry. How so?
Club employees shape member experience.
When a prospective or existing client walks into your gym or studio,
it’s your employees on the floor who greet them, answer their questions, lead their workouts, and give them a positive and memorable experience. Your members are looking for quality and consistency in your staff members. If their favorite trainer quits to work for another gym, guess who’s going to follow?
Constant turnover decreases morale.
As more employees leave, the ones who do stay often become overworked and less motivated in the wake of their departure. Then, not only is your current staff spread thinner with more responsibilities to pick up, but they have also lost team members with whom they’ve developed positive relationships.
Higher retention rates foster increased productivity.
The longer you retain an employee, the more valuable they become to your company in terms of gained experience and expertise. Constant turnover means constantly having a team of employees who have yet to optimize their workflow, are less familiar with your organization, and are less invested in your success.
High turnover rates increase company costs.
Did you know that the cost of replacing one of your employees is equivalent to up to
33% of their annual salary
? The bulk of these expenses comes from advertising for, interviewing, screening, and training new hires. But this hiring and training process will also decrease overall company productivity, resulting in a poor customer experience and, potentially, corresponding decreases in member retention.
5 Employee Retention Strategies to Help Your Gym or Fitness Club Thrive
The good news is that, in spite of the 2021 turnover trend for companies across all industries, gyms and fitness clubs are not powerless when it comes to employee retention. In fact, an analysis of the
Work Institute’s 2017 Retention Report
found that more than 75% of reasons for employee turnover are preventable.
Use these retention strategies to nurture your gym employees into happy and committed long-term members of your team!
1.   Open the lines of communication.
By regularly asking for and listening to employee feedback, you’ll learn what changes your employees want to see and make them feel like their opinions are valued. Schedule routine one-on-ones to check in with team members and learn how they are feeling, any concerns they have, and any ideas they’ve come up with to improve the employee and member experiences at your club. They’ll appreciate having a safe space to address issues and feeling like their voice is heard.
2.   Invest in employee training and development.
Fitness is constantly evolving, which means you and your team should be evolving along with it. Consistent trainings and growth opportunities will ensure your staff keeps up with the latest industry trends and knowledge, as well as keep them engaged.
Analytics and reporting tools
can help you identify opportunities for employee training.
3.    Give employees the tools they need to do their job.
Without proper resources and management support, employee performance will be suboptimal and staff members will become frustrated quickly. Provide them with innovative tools to make their job easier, such as a
mobile app
that allows them to communicate directly with clients and manage their own schedule or a streamlined
POS and inventory management system
. Be sure to set clear expectations and check on employee needs regularly, while offering them the space they need to work effectively and feel trusted.
4.    Offer rewards and incentives.
Incentivizing excellent performance and rewarding and recognizing hard work is crucial to employee satisfaction, motivation, and loyalty. Appropriately high wages, good medical benefits, regular raises, ample PTO, and target-based bonuses all work to retain good workers long-term. Don’t be afraid to get creative with incentives or recognition either.
Perks such as free branded merch for employees to wear, access to club amenities (e.g., free protein shakes from the smoothie bar, weekly allotted times for hydromassage chairs), and designated employees of the month can go a long way when paired with sufficient compensation and benefits.
5.    Promote work-life balance.
Today’s workers have little patience for jobs that demand so much of their time and energy that they miss out on enjoying the rest of their lives. Ensure your club staff have the tools they need to establish a fulfilling work-life balance. Plenty of PTO and flexibility in scheduling are key here. Also, make it a point to convey that self-care is a priority. Trendy events like yoga sessions and meditation workshops are great, but even more important are access to mental health resources and fostering an open, honest, and understanding work culture.

How To Maintain a Clean Facility
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:36:02 PM
This seems like a no brainer and you’re probably thinking that the answer is you simply clean your facility to maintain it. However, the cleanliness of your gym or fitness club goes a little deeper than that–a deep clean if you will. Not only does it affect the overall look, feel and brand of your gym, but according to
Fitness Magazine
, research says that members could be getting much more than flat abs at the gym, like fungi and Staph infections, the flu and even Hepatitis A and MRSA.
Even if you think your gym is spotless, it’s probably not. If you truly think about it, it’s no surprise that gyms are a haven for bacteria. Vast amounts of people with different health conditions carrying different germs, work out in your facility every day and sweat on your equipment.
Although you can’t control what people do, especially outside of your club, there are things you can do as a gym owner to make sure your facility sparkles because let’s face it: your members come to the gym to get healthy, not sick and a dirty gym is gross. Besides, people still try to stay active even when they have the common cold, which spreads germs but also the sicker a member is, the less time they are spending in your gym, and you don’t want that either. Here are some preventative measures you and your staff can take to minimize germs.

How to Prep Your Gym for the New Year
OFFER CLEANING STATIONS
Most gyms and fitness studios offer stations with paper towels and spray bottles filled with disinfectant solutions, but in case you don’t already, offering cleaning stations is a small preventative action you can take to immediately kill germs. You’re probably still wondering how many people actually use them, and unfortunately, that’s why gyms collect so much bacteria, because many people don’t, but that’s also because gyms don’t encourage it enough or in a way that they should.
Members are more likely to wipe down a treadmill after using it rather than a weight machine. According to
Natural News
, free weights are often used, but hardly ever cleaned. Exercise balls and mats are rarely cleaned either because people don’t always think about it, yet they carry bacteria like Staphylococcus.
If you have cleaning stations with signs that encourage and remind your members to wipe down equipment, you have a better chance of avoiding harmful bacteria, helping them in the long-run. Although you can’t force your members to actually use your cleaning stations, it’s better to have them than not at all. Besides, your members pay to work out in your facility, not clean it. So even though it’s common courtesy for them to wipe stuff down, it’s not their job to–it’s yours.
HIRE A CLEANING STAFF
Whether or not this is your general staff, make sure your employees are vacuuming, wiping down equipment that isn’t currently being used, maintaining bathrooms and locker rooms as well as picking up trash. We recommend you have a separate cleaning staff from your general employees because if you have your front desk person vacuuming when they should be welcoming people in, there’s a chance of missed opportunities for new members, and besides, you want different types of people running your facility, so that all member needs are met. It looks more professional for your overall brand to have employees walking around cleaning because it shows that you care about your club and that you care about your members feeling comfortable where they work out.
Simply relying on your members to get rid of germs by wiping down equipment is not enough. According to an experiment conducted by the
TODAY Show
, the buttons on cardio equipment at a New York gym carried a bacteria level of 2,134. Any bacteria level over 100 was considered a fail. Natural News says that even after people wipe down those machines, bacteria can still live on them for up to three days.
In other words, deep cleaning your facility is your best bet, plus members and guests definitely notice and appreciate those small details, which is vital to the success of your business. If you’re an owner of a boutique fitness studio that runs solely on group classes, like barre or yoga, it’s not a bad idea to have a cleaning staff, but you probably don’t need to worry about it as much since group classes are controlled and moderated by instructors, rather than the individual actions of members.
CHECK OUR DAILY SERVICE NOTES REPORT
Our Daily Service Notes Report is a good tool for ASF to inform your gym and staff of things you might not be aware of, like the cleanliness of it for instance. This could be anything like the bathrooms were dirty one day, or there was gum stuck to an elliptical. Specific complaints like that happen all of the time. Think about it this way. You don’t want your members exercising in a dirty environment. That’s unsanitary and embarrassing for you as a fitness club owner. Your members chose your gym for a reason. Whatever their deciding factor was, one of the worst things that could happen is a member cancelling their membership because they were grossed out.
The Daily Service Notes Report is perfect for very specific issues. Obviously, your club is a public place and public places will always carry germs no matter what, but the issues reach a whole level when it’s disrupting a member’s workout. Chances are when things like that happen, members will complain directly to your staff for an immediate solution, but either way, this report is imperative to check so that you, your staff and ASF are all on the same page and can resolve the issues when they arise.
USE OUR HOURLY ATTENDANCE REPORT
This report helps you determine the peak times and slow times of your facility each day, on the hour. You’re probably wondering how this report would help you clean your gym. If you have effectively determined your peak times, then you know that more people using your equipment also means more germs.
At the same time, you can determine your slower times to track when it’s okay to send your staff around to clean, especially if you don’t have a specific cleaning staff. Regardless, you should be cleaning your club or at least inspecting it every hour. This report helps you determine appropriate times to maintain it so that your members are always exercising in a clean environment.
CREATE A CLEANING CLOCK
Whatever this looks like or sounds like–whether it’s a reminder over the intercom or specific times all of your employees are aware of, everyone needs to be on the same page. With members and prospects coming in and out of your gym, asking questions and signing up for memberships, it’s easy to forget to clean, so simply setting cleaning reminders for your employees can resolve issues before they’re even a problem.
BOTTOM LINE
If people touch it, clean it. It’s better to be overly-detailed about the look and feel of your gym, than not enough.

How to Tell if You’re in Shape or Not
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:38:55 PM
It may not be rocket science, but it’s not always easy to detect whether you’re in shape or not. This is because there is not one definition of being “in shape,” according to
Business Insider
. It can be everything from having low body fat to having muscular strength. You could strength train often, but your cardiovascular health might not be up to par. This same concept applies in a situation when someone might appear skinny, but they have a higher amount of body fat and very little muscle. Although they appear thin, they aren’t necessarily “in shape.” If you exercise regularly, it’s a safe bet that you’re in shape, but here are specific ways to tell and see which areas you could improve in.
LOW HEART RATE
According to
Insider
, people who are in good physical shape have lower heart rates at 60-100 beats per minute. Their hearts pump harder with stronger beats. A number higher than that given range might indicate heart disease or high blood pressure.
QUICK RECOVERY TIME
If you can bounce back quickly after a tough workout, that usually is good indicator that you’re in shape. Take your pulse right after you’ve finished exercising, testing every minute after that to detect how fast it goes down. If it drops back to normal within about five minutes after your workout, then you are in good shape.
YOU CAN EASILY WALK UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS
This is a simple cardio test. If you’re able to walk up a flight of stairs without feeling winded, you’re in good shape. Keep in mind that factors like higher elevation and asthma can be deceiving. If you’re somewhere with high elevation that you’re not acclimated to, you might be gasping for air more frequently, but it doesn’t mean you’re out of shape.
YOU CAN EASILY RUN TWO MILES OR A 10-MINUTE MILE
Running a mile in 10 minutes or less and being able to run two miles without your heart pumping out of your chest are effective ways to test your cardiovascular health. If you’re slacking in this area, try jogging at a slow and consistent pace, gradually increasing your speed, or fast walk on a treadmill for 1-minute increments, followed by 30-second sprints to keep your heart rate up.
YOU CAN RISE FROM THE GROUND WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
This might be one of the most ignored fitness tests but is extremely helpful in determining whether or not you’re physically fit. According to
Health and Fitness Cheat Sheet
, sitting down then getting up without using your arms, knees or other body parts for assistance tests your muscular strength, flexibility and balance. If this is difficult for you, practice balancing exercises like single-leg deadlifts, walking lunges and planking while lifting one leg or arm. The more you practice this, the better your overall coordination will be.
YOU CAN DO 10 OR MORE FULL PUSH-UPS
There’s a reason many people dread push-ups–they’re not easy and certainly take practice to master, however, they’re an effective way to test your fitness levels because they use full body weight. If you can do 10 or more full push-ups, you’re on the right track.
YOU CAN EASILY HOLD A 60-SECOND PLANK
Just like with push-ups, planks use your full bodyweight, which is why they are great indicators of being physically fit. If you are able to hold a plank for 60 seconds or more without giving up, this is a sign that you have a strong core and lower back.
YOU CAN DO A FULL PULL-UP
Pull-ups are arguably one of the hardest exercises to perform, and majority of people cannot do a full one, so if you’re in that small pool of people who are able to, your upper body strength is not only top notch, but your overall fitness levels are too.
YOU CAN EASILY SWITCH THINGS UP
There’s something to be said about being able to do a variety of workouts. The next time you hit the gym, pay attention to how many different types of exercises you can do. Do you lift weights, do push-ups then sprint on a treadmill? Can you do a HIIT workout one day and get through a spin class another day? If your answer is yes, you’re in excellent shape. This is because being able to do many different types of exercises tests all areas of your fitness levels, not just one.
BOTTOM LINE
When it comes to being “in shape,” it’s important to focus on your goals and health rather than looking and being the skinniest. Goals matter because even if you can easily run two miles doesn’t mean you need to be in shape to run an entire marathon. If you focus on how you feel and what works best for you in your daily life, your version of being “in shape” will come with the package deal.

Increase Gym Revenue Using Point of Sale
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:37:01 PM
If you’re wholly focused on increasing revenue by increasing membership at your gym, you could be overlooking a powerful existing source of revenue: your current members! You can easily sell classes, merchandise, and more to your members by using point of sale (POS) software to increase gym revenue.
When done right and properly managed, retail sales could account for as much as
8%-10% of your gym’s revenue
. In this blog article, you’ll learn more about how your gym can leverage a POS to sell more and grow faster.
How to Increase Gym Revenue with POS
Although there are plenty of clubs and gyms that don’t have retail operations, it’s often because managing inventory and ringing up merchandise can be overwhelming for a small staff. Larger clubs often have a staff member — or entire team — devoted to managing retail operations. But with
point of sale and inventory management software
, your team can easily ring up items while
simultaneously tracking inventory
and delivering the best member experience possible.
When retail sales are easier to manage, your team can start getting to know your members better and selling merchandise that helps supplement their workouts. For example, if your club offers members a weight management or health coaching program, you may want to offer retail items like meal replacements, shakes, smoothies, books, journals, and other items to complement the journey.
If you’re not sold on the power of selling retail items, just look at how brands such as Peloton or SoulCycle have built a huge following of people walking around with their name plastered on shirts, laptop stickers, bumper stickers, and more. If your members can get everything they need at your gym, you’ll end up saving them time and boosting your bottom line.
17 Ideas for Selling More at Your Club
There are plenty of ways that your club can launch or expand existing retail operations. How much you offer will depend on the size of space you have and what your members could benefit most from. Start small by testing out different essential items, and grow your retail operations as members ask for new items.
For example: Does your club have a pool? There are countless pool accessories you can sell, including towels, goggles, swimsuits, and more. Do you offer boxing classes? Sell gloves. Are people always forgetting their headphones? Sell them!
Here are some other things you can add to your pro shop and sell through your POS:
Nutraceuticals (e.g., supplements and vitamins)
Branded apparel and accessories
Athleisure and athletic wear
Smoothies, water, or protein bars
Recovery equipment (e.g., foam rollers)
Gift memberships
Personal training packages
Group class packages
Bootcamp and challenge packages
Electrolyte drinks
Blender bottles
Toiletries or health/beauty products
Recipe or wellness books
Reusable bottles and thermoses
Sunscreen, lotion, and lip balm
Seasonal items (e.g., pumpkin-themed products for fall)
Yoga mats and accessories
Tips for Maximizing Retail Sales at Your Gym
Simply having retail items available for sale at your gym isn’t always enough — especially for members on a time crunch who are in and out. According to a RedPoint Global survey conducted by The Harris Poll, 54% of people are willing to
share personal information
if it will be used to create a personalized experience. Start by talking to your members to find out what they like, dislike, want, and need so you can cater to their preferences.
Here are a few additional tips to keep your point of sale software busy:
Keep tabs on health and wellness trends (
check out TikTok
) so you can keep your retail space full of popular items, clothes, or equipment.
In hot weather, ask members if they want a cold bottle of water or an electrolyte drink for recovery before they head back out.
Choose a few protein bars, cut them up in to small pieces, and offer them as samples to members.
Be sure you offer the items for sale on your website or
mobile app
, too, so you can maximize retail sales and meet members wherever they are.
Ask your personal trainers what products or accessories they’re recommending to their clients and then sell those.
No matter how popular an item is, make sure you’re only selling the products that you and your team believe in.
Don’t forget to advertise your new retail offerings through email, on social media, and any other medium you use to reach members and leads.
Also, it’s important to establish your gym as the most knowledgeable club out there, and being able to speak about the products you’re selling is part of that. Your members want to be able to trust you, so be sure your team knows everything there is to know about every product you’re selling.

Actionable Ways to Increase Business Visibility, Part 1
Posted by
Calley Mitchamore
on Aug 1, 2019 12:30:00 PM
It's a crowded and competitive market out there which means the success of your fitness business is tied directly to its visibility. Cultivating awareness of your club will pay dividends in two major ways. First, you'll be able to tap new groups of prospects currently unaware of your club. Second, visibility building strategies will help you better connect with and retain your current members. Consider that
64% of consumers
report feeling loyal to brands they interact with weekly, and that number jumps to 87% when a consumer interacts with a brand daily.
There is no one ""magic bullet"" to instantly boost club visibility. So, we'll dive into best practices and approaches you can implement to boost your fitness center's visibility with a three-part blog series. Read on for our first 10 strategies.
1.)
We are assuming that your business is already on Google Maps and Yelp. If it isn't, you're in luck! Check out the blogs we wrote which can help:
How to get your gym or fitness business on Google Maps,
and
How to get your gym or fitness business on Yelp
.
2.)
If your business is on Google Maps, but you're not the one that put it there, you need to take back control of the posting.
Do that here
. Same thing for Yelp.
Do that here
.
3. Build out your social media presence.
It goes without saying, your fitness business needs to have a presence on any and all social channels your members and target prospects frequent. Each social media platform offers unique benefits for fitness centers. Make sure you understand the differing strengths of sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube and know how to leverage them to your advantage. Not sure where to start? Check out our
First Steps To Social Media Marketing blog
.
4.)
Collect as much
“social proof”
as possible. Consider “social proof” the closest you can get to word-of-mouth advertising. For our purposes, social proof is anything that allows others to read the thoughts of someone that’s already using your services. Get as many positive reviews and quotes about your business as possible and use them wherever you believe they’d generate the best results. Be strategic about it. We suggest using social proof on your contact, sign up, pricing, and/or schedule pages. Basically, use them anywhere you think someone might need a little extra push.
5.)
Want more Google Maps, Yelp, etc. reviews? At a predetermined stage in a client or member's ""buyer journey"", send them an email asking if they'd
leave a review
on your desired platform(s). Reviews do ""just happen"" but they'll ""just happen"" a heck of a lot more if you put an outreach plan in place. We have seen businesses go from 0 to 100+ positive reviews in a couple days with this method.
6.)
How to know if someone should receive the above email:
Prequalify them
by reaching out to see if they have any questions, or if there's anything you can help them with regarding their experience at your business. If they respond positively, you can send them a follow-up asking if they'd be willing to leave a review on whatever platforms are the most beneficial to you.
7.)
Don't forget about the
power of the sandwich board
. What's a sandwich board? The stand-up signs, often featuring chalkboard fronts, placed on the sidewalk in front of delis, pubs, spas, and really businesses of all kinds. Some businesses rely on this seemingly insignificant and overly simple method to draw people inside. Don't be afraid to get creative with it. It's not just the act of putting out a sandwich board that will help, it's really thinking about it and trying to differentiate your business from the others around you - even non-competitors as they're still distracting your potential new members or clients.
8.)
Always think about where you're posting something before you ask yourself what or how you should post it. Sites like Google Maps and Yelp are so extremely important to fitness and gym businesses because they show intent on the part of the searcher. If someone in your area searches Google Maps for ""gym,"" you want to be at the top of the results because the person who searched that is showing an
intent to buy
what you're offering.
9.)
Take
Yelp Biz
on the go by downloading their app. You can manage your
Yelp
listing and reviews right from your phone.
10.)
Almost nothing in marketing is ""set it and forget it."" Even when it comes to reviews, you can't forget to ask for them and you certainly can't forget to ""review the reviews"" from time to time.
Don’t allow negative reviews to go unanswered!
And remember, whatever you say in response will most likely be public and able to be read by current and future members.
11.)
Take Google business services on the go by downloading their app. You can manage your
Google Maps
and other Google business services all from your phone.

Actionable Ways to Increase Business Visibility, Part 2
Posted by
Calley Mitchamore
on Aug 6, 2019 7:00:00 AM
Noticing your prospect pipeline drying up? It could be because fresh prospects -- the prospects you badly need -- have no idea your business exists. You can't grow your fitness center without growing your fitness center's presence -- both online and offline -- first.
We're exploring best practices and approaches you can implement to boost your fitness center's visibility with a three-part blog series. If you haven't read part one yet,
we highly recommend you
check it out
first!
If you have, read on for another great list of visibility-boosting strategies:
1.)
Foursquare and Swarm
: If you've never heard of these two companies that's alright. They're technically the same company, but a few years ago Foursquare decided to break their app in two and created Swarm. However, if your business is on Foursquare then it’s automatically on Swarm.
Foursquare/Swarm can be quite lucrative if used correctly. There isn't much of a difference in “find what you’re looking for” functionality between these services and Google Maps or Yelp except for the fact that their demographic skews much younger. So, if your business has a lot of millennial clientele, you'll want to invest some time into Foursquare/Swarm.
Here's a link on how to get started
.
2.)
Have a
mobile-friendly website
. In today's world it is simply a necessity. If a potential client or member can’t easily search for a business like yours, find your awesome website, and then have an easy, informative experience - all from their phone - then they’ll simply close the webpage and go back to the search results to find another business. Need to test your website to find out how mobile-friendly it is?
Google can help
.
3.)
Additionally,
every single email you send needs to be mobile-friendly
. This is an absolute necessity. You may be saying “I know this,” but have you actually tested what your emails look like within the most popular email services? You may be surprised.
4.)
Geographic targeting
in online ads can be incredibly useful and a great way to avoid wasting money on ads that won't be seen by the right people. With the right geo-targeted ad, you can spend way less money and achieve considerably higher returns. Using your current member or client data, do a search for zip codes and do your best to plot out where most of them live in relation to your location (cool rhyme!) and then transfer that knowledge to an appropriate online ad.
Learn about Google’s geographic ads
. |
Learn about Facebook’s geographic ads
.
5.)
Direct mail isn't dead!
We wrote an entire blog about it which
you can read here
. Direct mail doesn't have to be overwhelming and you never have to go to the post office. When done correctly, there’s a chance you’ll see an ROI beyond anything you do online.
6.)
Apple Maps
is growing. You need to ensure your business is on it. Check to make sure. We even wrote a blog about Apple Maps and
how to do this
.
7.)
Define and use
keywords
: If you want to rank at the top of Google search results, you have to define what it is people are searching for that relates to your business and then you need to strategically use those words (known as “keywords”) throughout your website. Sneaky SEO techniques no longer work. Google is all about organic content that’s relevant to the person searching. So, if someone searches “gym with clean locker rooms” on Google, and you’ve specifically mentioned in various (relevant) places on your website that you have “clean locker rooms,” there is a much higher chance of you showing up in Google search results before any of your competitors that don’t mention their clean lockers. Learn how to find the keywords you should be using
here
.
8.)
Re-marketing
: You’ve spent time and probably some money getting people to your website, but just because they’ve arrived doesn’t mean they’re going to take the desired action. When this happens, you don’t want the last interaction to be when they close their browser window. To prevent this, you can “follow them around the internet” with relevant, non-intrusive ads. It seems weird and a little creepy, but it can work. A service called
AdRoll
can help. Our suggestion is to start small and use re-marketing strategically. Not every page on your website needs to trigger a re-marketing cookie in the visitor’s browser. However, if they land on your homepage and then navigate to your services or membership page they will be a much better candidate to receive re-marketing ads as they’ve shown an intent to buy. Re-marketing ads aren’t annoying to the viewer if you target the correct audience.
9.)
What better way to get in front of your local and ideal clients than with a
local  newspaper or magazine
? Depending on who your ideal clients are, you could take out an ad in a local newspaper or a local health and fitness magazine should one exist. Either way, you’re reaching people who live in your desired areas. A local weekly is a great idea as it has a large circulation, is free, and sits on newsstands much longer than standard newspapers.
10.)
Partner locally
. Look for businesses that align with yours, or are complements to what you offer. Juice bars, health food stores, etc. But don’t neglect the places where people may be looking for inspiration or life changes!

Kidcheck Gives Owners & Parents Peace of Mind
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:37:20 PM
Getting to know your members and tending to their needs is important. Do you know which of your members are parents? Chances are, you have quite a few walking into your facility every day. Or you have prospects lined up who are looking for a gym or fitness club that has a kids’ area and a way to safely and quickly check them in, so parents can go about their workouts stress-free.
Being a parent is a whole separate job in itself. They’re always on the go, constantly running around, picking up toys and cleaning up some kind of mess. For many parents, the last thing they want to do is neglect their workouts because they don’t have time to take their children to daycare or because daycare is too expensive.
This applies especially to mothers who are trying to get back in shape post-pregnancy. To ensure you’re keeping these members satisfied and attracting all types of prospects, it’s best to have great check-in software in your kids’ area. That’s where
KidCheck
, a secure and mobile-friendly children’s check-in system comes in to make your facility more efficient and make your members’ lives a little easier.
REDUCES LIABILITY
The biggest peace of mind for a parent is the safety of their children. KidCheck increases child security by ensuring only authorized care takers can check kids out. Once a child is checked in, KidCheck software displays any allergy or medical information that your staff needs to know regarding your member’s child. In the event of an emergency, the software also gives employees the ability to quickly know where parents are located.
EFFICIENT AND SECURE
Since parents are busy and on-the-go, it’s important to have a system that is fast and easy to use, whether a parent is checking in at the kids’ club in your facility or using a mobile app. With KidCheck Express Check-In, right on their own phone, parents can start check in at home while finishing a cup of coffee and getting ready to run out the door, or in the parking lot right outside the gym, wherever it’s most convenient for them.
That means that as a fitness club or gym owner, you won’t have long lines or stressed parents because members can easily and conveniently check their kids in which ultimately results in more efficiency for your facility. Parents also receive automatic, one-way text messages to confirm that they have checked their child in and reminder texts for when it’s time to pick their child up–this way they can enjoy their workouts but also be in the loop at the same time, keeping everyone on the same page.
REDUCES COST
Understanding your club and your members is crucial, and it’s essential to track when parents and children come into your facility, both for the sake of members and reducing costs. Just like how our reports offer your club real data, KidCheck manages trends so you can understand information like how many parents are coming to work out and at what times.
By understanding your peak and slow times, you can decide how many employees you need working your kids’ club, so you don’t spend money over-staffing. There are also benefits with reduced liability as a secure children’s check-in system improves child safety. You can also market things like mommy-and-me classes on certain days and at specific times, depending on what your data shows. Not only will these types of activities attract current and possible new members, but you’ll make more money in the long-run just for knowing when people are coming to work out.

5 Ways to Leverage Data Analytics to Improve Gym Operations: Insights from Anytime Fitness
Posted by
Club OS
on May 27, 2025 12:49:01 PM
Originally published on
Athletech News
At ClubOS, we know how powerful data analytics can be in driving revenue growth, improving member retention, and achieving overall business success for fitness clubs and gyms.
As part of Athletech News'
DISRUPT 2024
video series event, Kristen Coy, Director of Customer Success at ClubOS, and Stacy Anderson, Global President of Anytime Fitness, were interviewed by Edward Hertzman, CEO of
Athletech News
. They discussed how gym owners can harness data to thrive in today's competitive fitness business landscape.
This dynamic Q&A was packed with insights—here are a few highlights from the conversation on leveraging data to improve decision-making, member retention, business transformation, and more.
Watch the full interview here.
1. How Gyms Owners Should Use Data to Inform Their Decision Making
Kristen explains that data analytics helps gym owners confirm what’s working, pinpoint areas for improvement, and uncover trends to nurture leads, boost revenue, and optimize daily operations. Using data effectively can provide fitness businesses with a clear path toward smarter decision-making and sustainable growth.
2. Use Member Engagement Data to Drive Retention and Revenue Growth
Kristen emphasizes that keeping gym members engaged is essential for improving retention rates and increasing lifetime value. She advises fitness club operators to stay ahead of customer needs by gathering insights through regular surveys, tracking engagement metrics, and making data-driven improvements to facilities and services.
3. Avoid the Pitfall: 'Bad Data In, Bad Data Out'
Kristen highlights a critical challenge for fitness clubs: inaccurate or incomplete data inputs. “Bad data in is bad data out,” she warns, underscoring the importance of staff training and working closely with software and tech partners. High-quality, intuitive data analytics empowers gym owners to make informed decisions that can truly transform their business.
4. Leverage AI to Enhance Member Engagement and Maximize Lifetime Value
Stacy explains that many gym operators focus heavily on new member acquisition and attrition while overlooking opportunities in the middle of the customer journey. By using AI-powered tools to analyze member behavior and preferences, fitness clubs can enhance engagement, extend membership duration, and increase profit margins.
5. How Anytime Fitness Uses Data to Guide Growth and Expansion
Stacy shares how Anytime Fitness utilizes data analytics tools to identify successful areas for new gym locations by analyzing demographics and assessing market potential. This data-driven approach helps the brand make smarter expansion decisions while also supporting franchisees with resources to improve financial literacy and operational success.
The fitness industry is moving into a new era, and data analytics has become an essential tool for gym owners to stay competitive. Whether your goal is to improve member retention, grow your revenue, expand your services, or plan for long-term business growth, knowing how to leverage your data, and using the right tools can make all the difference.
At ClubOS, we’re here to help you turn data insights into action.

Announcement: Membership Collections in Reserve for 30 Days
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:36:05 PM
Due to COVID-19, our industry is facing unprecedented challenges. Many clubs are temporarily—or, in some cases, permanently—closing their doors.
In doing our part to preserve your business and contribute to the sustainability and longevity of the industry we all love so dearly, we are making some changes to mitigate liability in these uncertain times. We are actively monitoring gym collections during this time and, unsurprisingly, we are seeing an increase in member chargebacks and/or refund demands.
Effective immediately, ASF will hold 10% of all membership collections in reserve until 30 days after the applicable facility has reopened and is operating under normal circumstances. Funds reserved on your account will be held and safeguarded for your benefit and, until released back to you, will only be used to pay chargebacks and/or refund demands raised from your members, or other fees that are owed to ASF from time to time. Doing this will prevent both you and ASF from being liable if or when members perform chargebacks and/or demand refunds through their credit card providers and automated clearing houses. The reserve funds will be released to you once the COVID-19 crisis is behind us.
We will continually monitor and reevaluate this policy as this industry crisis unfolds. This action is to help ensure that your business can weather the storm and be in the best possible position once clubs reopen.
We are happy to answer your questions. Please reach out to our
Client Support team at 1-800-527-6898.

Month One: Are Your Members Up For The Challenge?
Posted by
Robert Koehler
on May 13, 2021 1:58:23 PM
In a world full of countless fitness options, it’s vital to make your business stand out from the crowd. New studios, gyms, and class formats seem to be popping up daily, and it’s imperative to find ways to engage with both prospects and members alike to increase retention. Thinking outside the box to get your members excited about working out is crucial to making sure they feel special and to helping keep their fitness routines feel innovative and exciting. One outside-the-box way to invite interaction with your member base is by designing unique club challenges for them to participate in. Depending on your industry, challenges can be as simple as a weight-loss goal or as involved as achieving set levels of MEPs or caloric goals. Challenges are a great way to foster relationships with your existing members and build a little friendly competition around the club! They also make a great talking point with prospects and show potential members that you care about their wellness journey and want to encourage them to reach their goals.
Offering prizes at the end of a challenge is a great way to encourage participation, but often, your members will be happy with the idea of earning those much-deserved bragging rights. Leadership boards and daily updates are a fun way to keep track of members’ progress throughout the course of a challenge, giving people a chance to feel like they’re being recognized for their hard work. We’ve put together a list of some fun challenges that are easy to implement, but these are just the start: the possibilities are endless! Think of some viable solutions for the goals at your club, considering what your members ultimately want to achieve from time spent at your facility.
Check-In Challenge
A Check-in Challenge is a great way to encourage traffic to your gym by giving members an extra incentive to head to the club after a long day’s work or right when their alarm clock goes off in the morning. Prizes can be given to the member with the most check-ins over a period of time, or make everyone feel like a winner by giving every member who checks in 20 times a new piece of club swag or a free smoothie.
Calories Burned Challenge
One of the biggest reasons millions of people go to the gym should be no surprise: to lose weight and burn off those pesky calories. Integrate your club’s app or progress tracking system and put your members’ journey back into their hands Alternatively, members can download a myriad of fitness apps to track caloric progress so everyone can feel included in the fun. This also gives you the opportunity to show members’ progress with before/after photos or testimonials, which can serve as a great marketing tool for your gym down the road, even after the challenge is complete. Be sure to include a release agreement that will permit you to use those member photos in future marketing.
Group Fitness Challenge
If your club or studio offers group fitness or class options, this challenge is a great way to build participation and drive potential revenue to premium options. Throw a bingo card into the mix to drive more attendees to explore specific instructors, class times during the week that could use a boost in attendance, or different formats that you just launched on the schedule. This type of challenge also encourages members to try a new type of workout and see all the advantages that group fitness offers. Your members and instructors alike will be thrilled by the results of this challenge, and you just might help someone find their new favorite workout!

Building a Unique Fitness Community with Engaging Instructors
Creating and sustaining a thriving community within a fitness studio starts with how you build your team. Ashley Robinson, owner of Spoke Cycle, emphasizes the importance of hiring instructors who are not just capable but passionate, humble, and driven.
“Passion…you can’t fake it, right? You have to believe in this type of fitness and our mission,”
Robinson underscores. She adds that having a sense of humility and drive also plays a crucial role in maintaining an inclusive and motivated team.
Robinson’s approach to team building highlights the necessity of selecting individuals who naturally align with the studio’s mission of fostering an encouraging and energetic environment. This strategy translates into enthusiastic instructors who genuinely enjoy their roles, thereby enhancing the overall member experience.
By engaging fully with members—before, during, and after classes—the instructors help to create an “unmatched community” that leaves a lasting impression. This method cultivates loyalty and ensures that the fitness journey remains enjoyable and sustainable for both the staff and the members.
The Impact of Social Media on Building and Retaining a Community
In today’s digital age, social media isn’t just an afterthought; it’s a fundamental part of member engagement and community building. Robinson explains,
“Social media has been so important…it’s been our number one member acquisition channel.”
The emphasis on a vibrant and active social media presence allows Spoke Cycle to engage with their community effectively, fostering personal connections that transcend the studio walls.
Robinson has dedicated two staff members solely to manage Spoke Cycle’s social media platforms. This decision ensures that the studio’s online presence remains robust, consistent, and personal—qualities that resonate with their millennial and Gen Z audience.
“Make it personal. I feel like you’ll see with a lot of big box gyms that it’s just cookie cutter, and that just doesn’t work,”
Robinson asserts.
The strategy involves showcasing real members and their stories, thus making the content relatable and engaging. This method not only aids in member retention but also attracts new clients who see a community they want to join. Social media platforms become an extension of the inclusive and supportive environment cultivated inside the studio, thereby strengthening the brand’s identity and reach.
Effective Training and Staff Retention Strategies
One of the most significant challenges in the fitness industry is staff turnover. However, Robinson’s approach at Spoke Cycle emphasizes extensive training and continuous development, which contributes to lower turnover rates. She shares,
“Our new instructors go through a comprehensive two-month training program. Once you’re committed and you’re in…you’re all in.”
This rigorous training ensures that instructors are not only well-prepared but also deeply invested in the studio’s mission and values. Furthermore, regular reviews and opportunities for growth within the company help to keep staff motivated. Robinson notes the importance of giving instructors room for growth, whether through becoming a lead instructor or taking on additional responsibilities like managing merchandise.
Moreover, continuous feedback and open lines of communication play a crucial role. Robinson conducts annual reviews and mid-year check-ins to gather instructors’ input and implement their ideas.
“Their opinions and their ideas are going to keep us moving forward,”
she remarks, highlighting the value of inclusivity in decision-making processes.
Key Takeaways
The success of boutique fitness studios like Spoke Cycle hinges on several interconnected strategies:
Effective Team Building:
Hiring passionate, humble, and driven individuals helps create an inclusive and energetic community. Engaging with members personally strengthens the bonds within the studio, making the fitness journey enjoyable and sustainable.
Social Media Engagement:
A stark focus on a robust, personalized social media presence aids in member retention and acquisition. By employing not just one, but
two
dedicated social media managers, Spoke Cycle ensures that their online engagement remains genuine and reflective of the studio’s vibrant community.
Comprehensive Training and Staff Retention:
Extensive, thoughtful training programs coupled with regular feedback and opportunities for growth contribute to lower turnover rates. Empowering instructors through continuous development and inclusivity in decision-making processes helps maintain a motivated and committed team.
These elements combined create a powerful framework for boutique fitness studios aiming to build strong, enduring communities both within and beyond their physical spaces.

Advice on Opening a Gym & Choosing the Right Software
Posted by
Club OS
on Nov 18, 2024 2:32:10 PM
Few individuals are as influential and insightful in the fitness industry as Al Noshirvani, Owner of
Method Gym
. As an expert in the field, Al has made waves with his innovative approaches and unparalleled expertise.
As an IHRSA board member, the cofounder of Motionsoft, the Founder of the Fitness Technology Summit, and many other roles, Al has unequivocally established himself as one of the thought leaders in our space.
Al has recently embarked on a new venture as the proud owner of Method Gym—a club whose mission is to provide a fun and affordable environment where all members feel comfortable finding their method and making their fitness journey their own. The grand opening parties for their three locations were held in early May 2023 and marked the beginning of an exciting chapter for Al and his team.
Join us for a quick-fire Q&A session with Al to understand how the Method Gym team uses our solutions to achieve remarkable success in the fitness industry.
What key elements did you look for in a software provider and technology platform?
Al: We needed a fully integrated solution to manage incoming leads, memberships, bookings, and staff. We also needed it to scale with us as our memberships increased and our team grew.
We were also looking for a partner open to nuanced requests for product feature enhancements as we continue to learn more about what our members need. Finally, we wanted a robust API setup that would allow us to build the ideal technology ecosystem.
What key features of ClubOS have helped you the most, and how?
Al: We liked the fact that we had a fully integrated solution with a unified workflow. It helps with staff training and onboarding from day one of implementation and ongoing.
We also appreciate how the ClubOS team listens to our feedback on enhancements and features. More impressive, though, was how they collaborated with us—it’s a true partnership.
What is the most important step you took while preparing to launch your new fitness brand?
Al: Of course, it was important to select the name and brand identity and demonstrate how they supported our mission, but the key was to ensure our staff bought into what we were doing.
I asked a good friend and long-time industry colleague, Tom Johnston from Talent Optimizer, to help me craft that message and establish a process for disseminating it.
Did you have any major concerns as you prepared to transition from one payment processing platform to another?
Al: We assumed we would see a dip in our collections rate in the few months following the transition for a variety of reasons. However, we have been able to achieve an impressive 96% collection rate.
That success wouldn’t have been possible without the strong alignment with our partners at ClubOS and their software.
What would you do differently if you were to do the rebrand/launch process again?
Al: Take more time to plan. It’s never enough!
What is one piece of advice you would give to other gym/franchise owners who are considering opening a gym?
Al: Focus on what you want to be and who you want to serve, and ensure all your staff understands it, too. I see many operators in our industry react to business conditions in a knee-jerk way.
Specifically, we decided that just because a low-price provider opens down the street doesn’t mean we need to lower our prices. We doubled down and focused on service and programming.
Achieve Success like Al with the Right Gym Management Software Partner
Al Noshirvani’s journey in the fitness industry is a testament to the power of innovative thinking, strategic planning, and using the right tools for success.
One key factor contributing to Al’s achievements is his partnership with ClubOS. A robust gym management software solution has proven instrumental in helping Al’s gym streamline operations, manage memberships, and optimize staff training.
If you’re about to embark on the exciting journey of opening your own gym, we encourage you to take the next step toward success by
scheduling a demo
.
Discover firsthand how this robust software solution can transform your gym management, enhance member experiences, and propel your business to new heights.

Q&A with Al Noshirvani: Advice on Opening a Gym & Choosing the Right Software
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:39:02 PM
By Al Noshirvani, Owner, Method Gym, and Nick Hahn, VP Product of Club OS & ASF
When it comes to the fitness industry, there are few individuals as influential and insightful as Al Noshirvani. As a seasoned thought leader in the field, Al has made waves with his innovative approaches and unparalleled expertise.
As an IHRSA board member, the cofounder of
Motionsoft
, the Founder of the
Fitness Technology Summit
, and many other roles in his track record, Al has unequivocally established himself as one of
the
thought leaders in our space.
Al has recently embarked on a new venture as the proud owner of
Method Gym
—a club whose mission is to provide a fun and affordable environment where all members feel comfortable
finding their method
and making their fitness journey their own. The grand opening parties for their three locations were held in early May and marked the beginning of an exciting chapter for Al and his team.
Join the ASF team for a quick-fire Q&A session with Al and Nick Hahn, the VP of Product & Development at Club OS, to understand how the Method Gym team uses gym management software to achieve remarkable success in the fitness industry.
What were the key elements you looked for in a software provider and technology platform?
We needed a solution to manage incoming leads, memberships, bookings, and staff in a fully integrated way. We needed it to scale with us as our memberships increased and our team grew.
We were also looking for a partner who would be open to nuanced requests for product feature enhancements as we continue to learn more about what our members need. And finally, a robust API setup that would allow us to build the ideal technology ecosystem.
What are the key features of Club OS/ASF that have helped you the most, and how?
We liked the fact that we had a fully integrated solution with a unified workflow. It helps with training and onboarding of staff from day one of implementation and ongoing.
We also appreciate the way that the Club OS/ASF team listens to our feedback as it relates to enhancements and features. More impressive, though, was the way they collaborated with us—it’s a true partnership.
What is the most important step you took while preparing to launch your new fitness brand?
Selecting the name and brand identity and how they supported our mission was, of course, important, but ensuring our staff bought into what we were doing was the key.
I asked a good friend and long-time industry colleague, Tom Johnston from Talent Optimizer, to help me craft that message and establish a process for disseminating it.
Did you have any major concerns as you prepared to transition from one payment processing platform to another?
We assumed we would see a dip in our collections rate in the few months following the transition for a variety of reasons. However, we have been able to achieve an impressive 96% collection rate.
That success wouldn’t have been possible without the strong alignment with our partners at ASF and their software.
What would you do differently if you were to do the rebrand/launch process again?
Take more time to plan. It’s never enough!
What is one piece of advice you would give to other gym/franchise owners who are considering opening a gym?
Focus on what you want to be and who you want to serve and ensure all your staff understand it too. I see a lot of operators in our industry react to business conditions in a knee-jerk way.
Specifically, we decided that just because a low-price provider opens down the street doesn’t mean that we need to drop our prices. We double down and focus on service and programming.
Achieve Success like Al with the Right Gym Management Software Partner
Al Noshirvani’s journey in the fitness industry is a testament to the power of innovative thinking, strategic planning, and using the right tools for success.
One key factor that has contributed to Al’s achievements is his partnership with Club OS/ASF. A robust gym management software solution has proven instrumental in helping Al’s gym streamline operations, manage memberships, and optimize staff training.
If you’re about to embark on the exciting journey of opening your own gym, we encourage you to take the next step toward success by
scheduling a demo of Club OS/ASF
.
Discover firsthand how this robust software solution can transform your gym management, enhance member experiences, and ultimately propel your business to new heights.

Signs You’re Overdoing it at the Gym
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:37:13 PM
The gym may be a place for self-improvement, however, it is possible for it to negatively impact your fitness journey if you don’t find the right balance. Whether you’re a gym junkie or just signed up with a gym, anyone can work their body too much and hurt themselves if they aren’t careful. Here are some general warning signs to watch out for.
6 Signs You’re Over Doing It at the Gym
LINGERING SORENESS AND JOINT PAIN
Exercise and muscle soreness go hand and hand, and if you’re new to working out, it’s normal to be sore for longer, however, if the soreness prolongs for three days or more, your body is telling you to take a chill pill, because it’s likely experiencing more than DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) and could be a joint-related injury, according to
Shape Magazine
.
Take at least one or two rest days to let your body recover, especially if you’re just starting out in the gym. New gym-goers are more prone to joint injuries because they typically don’t have proper form. Remember not to rush during a workout, as this can cause permanent muscle or joint damage and focus on quality, not quantity while weightlifting. Learn more about muscle soreness
here
.
YOU’RE GETTING SICK
This includes both getting the common cold and feeling nauseous during a workout. If you’re someone who exercises regularly and you’re experiencing common cold symptoms like a sore throat and runny nose, it’s time to pump the breaks at the gym. If during a workout you begin to feel light headed, dizzy and nauseous, this is typically an indicator that you’re running on an empty stomach, you ate too much right before a workout, you’re dehydrated or you’re simply pushing yourself too hard.
Drink plenty of water during your workout and make sure to focus on your breathing. When it comes to food, it’s best to eat a small amount 30 minutes to an hour before a workout to ensure you have substance to fuel your body, but not too much that it makes you sick to your stomach.
POOR PERFORMANCE
Whether you’re in pain because you pulled a muscle, you’re low on energy or you feel weak lifting weights, you should consider parting ways with the gym for a little bit. Many people have the misconception that they need to put in maximum effort to see results, but it’s not always the smartest choice to push your limits because sometimes it’s not physically possible. Not only will your workouts suffer, but your results will too, according to Shape.
BOREDOM AND LACK OF MOTIVATION
This may not seem like an outcome of overdoing it at the gym, but if you’re constantly doing the same workout, you might want to either take a break or consider mixing up your routine because results will begin to plateau or move backwards. Although it’s normal for anyone not to be in the mood to hit the gym, you should never dread going, especially if you’re a regular. According to Shape, you might begin your workout unmotivated, but endorphins should kick in as you start to sweat. If after a little while this is not the case, that’s actually a hint to take a break.
CHANGE IN SLEEPING PATTERNS
Although exercise is supposed to help you sleep better, overdoing it at the gym can actually counteract your sleeping patterns.
Men’s Journal
says that pushing your body too much can cause insomnia or oversleeping. If you’re abnormally tired at the beginning of a workout, this is also an indicator that you should rest.
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND HIGH RESTING HEART RATE
You may not even know your resting heart rate or take your blood pressure, but both can be helpful in determining whether you need to chill out at the gym. According to
12 Minute Athlete
, if you’re an avid exerciser and have high blood pressure but have no other risk factors for it, it’s most likely because you’re working out too much. People who are in shape have resting heart rates of 50 or 60 bpm and the average person’s resting heart rate is 72 bpm. If your heart rate is significantly higher than that and you’re in good shape, it’s time to rest.

Talk Data to Me, Part I: Using ASF Dashboard Data to Drive Club Revenue
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:37:27 PM
Data is an integral part of running a successful gym. Knowing how your club is performing allows you to determine what areas need work, what areas are doing well, and how you can refine your operations and strategies to reach your business goals.
In fact, data is so important in the fitness industry that Sarah Pellegrino — a host of
The Fitness Business
podcast
— teamed up with Nick Hahn — our VP of Product at ASF and Club OS — to explore the topic further in our webinar series,
Talk Data to Me
. For the first episode, Sarah and Nick dug into the spicy details of how
ASF Dashboards
can help club owners harness the power of data to grow their business, broken down into three pillars: revenue, remittance, and membership.
In case you missed their first chat, we’ve put together an overview of the dashboard pillars below and how they impact your club.
Watch the First Webinar Episode Here
Pillar I: Revenue
The first pillar of the ASF Dashboards is revenue. Our dashboards make it easy to see and focus on your club’s gross and net revenue, as well as your various revenue streams. Let’s take a look at some of the most valuable features Nick and Sarah discussed for club owners to take advantage of in the revenue dashboard.
KPI Tracking
Your
KPIs (key performance indicators)
are displayed at the top of the revenue dashboard, so you can compare the data to your goals.
Easy visibility into these metrics
is important for gym owners because they allow you to determine whether your current marketing and operating strategies have you on track to reach revenue and other goals or if you need to reevaluate.
Monthly Revenue Comparisons
In your revenue dashboard, you can also compare current and previous revenue in an easy-to-interpret visual chart. The chart will automatically pull revenue data from the current month you’re looking at, the previous month, and the same month of the previous two years and display it in comparison.
Armed with this data, you’re able to more accurately anticipate the revenue you can expect for the month and determine
what you need to do to reach previous benchmarks
. For example, if you’re halfway through the month of March but you’re trailing your revenue from this time last year, you may want to run a promotional campaign to give those numbers a boost.
View Add-On Revenue
Another data point you can easily view in your ASF revenue dashboard is your add-on revenue, which is broken down by types of payments to show the effective rates of each distribution. Having a clearer picture of where your biggest revenue and cost streams are helps you better decide which areas are worth the continued investment.
For instance, Nick worked with a customer to review their revenue dashboard and was able to identify a cost-cutting opportunity. He noticed the club had a significant amount of revenue coming in through statement-based billing, which requires a higher processing rate. In this scenario, an effective solution would be to reach out to club members and encourage them to switch to EFT (electronic funds transfer) payment, possibly with a discount incentive.
Pillar II: Remittance
Remittance is an especially important data insight to have for small business owners, such as individual clubs. They say cash is king, after all, right? Well, your remittance dashboard keeps track of where your cash is and when it’s coming into your bank account. You’ll have clear visibility into what revenue still needs to be deposited, helping you ensure you can pay your bills on time.
Pillar III: Membership
The membership dashboards you’ll have access to with ASF will provide some of the most valuable data for your club’s growth. There are several dashboards — Overview, New Memberships, and Churn — that, together, give you a comprehensive overview of your current membership base and trends. You can see everything from active and new memberships to churn and beyond.
In the webinar, Sarah and Nick dug into a few of the most important membership data points for gym owners to track using their ASF Dashboards.
Net New Memberships
Your membership dashboard allows you to view both new and net new memberships. If there is a large discrepancy between how many new members you brought in during a certain month and how many you lost, that’s an insight worth investigating. This is especially relevant now, as the fitness industry is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
For example, the ASF customer success team worked with one club to get to the bottom of why their net new memberships had been trending downward. They discovered that one of their locations was bringing the number down because of how many frozen memberships they still had.
Considering
only about 30% of gym members
have returned to their gym since lockdowns, these findings may not be so surprising. But knowing the cause of their net new member decrease allows the club to
do something about it
, such as run a campaign targeting frozen members that promotes new equipment, classes, and safety protocols.
Membership Churn
Having your club’s membership churn data in one concise place helps you drill into the root causes of why your net memberships may not be meeting your expectations. One of the most useful data points in ASF’s membership dashboard is the reason for cancellation. Although collecting this data depends on your team asking lost members for it directly, once you have it, it’s invaluable for reengaging lost members with personalized communications.
Let’s say, for instance, the most common reason members reported cancelling their memberships last year was to cut costs. After running your dashboard to see cancellation by membership tier, you discover that most cancellations that fell under that reason were by premium members. Now that you know why they left, your staff can reach out and discuss other, more cost-friendly membership tiers they may be willing to return for.
ASF can also help you reengage lost members with our
Club OS integration
. Using your dashboards, you can see which membership demographics are leaving and why. Then, Club OS allows you to create custom emails that can be segmented and targeted to those demographics.
Upselling & Cross-Selling Members
As you look at your new membership dashboard, you can also see how many of those new memberships actually came from existing members who upgraded. Nick has found that, on average, a club will upgrade 5 existing members for every 100 new members they bring in over the course of a month. However, the highest performing customers are upgrading at least 10 members for every 100 monthly.
Evidently, engaging current customers with opportunities to upsell and cross-sell can often be a bigger revenue driver than new member acquisition. In fact,
research shows
that existing customers are 50% more likely to try new products and spend 31% more when compared to new customers. When you can easily see trends in which member demographics are making which upgrades, you can take greater advantage of those upselling and cross-selling opportunities.
Make Better Business Decisions for Your Club with ASF Dashboards
When you have the
analytics and reporting tools
you need to make data-based decision for your gym, you can boost member acquisition, retention, engagement, and revenue. ASF Dashboards offer clear summaries of how your club is performing in different areas, consolidated across all sources of data to make your life easier. With our visually pleasing data presentation, you can quickly see in what directions your club is trending and identify the best strategies for reaching your goals.

Talk Data to Me, Part II: Choosing the Right Communication Methods to Maximize Gym Member Conversions
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:34:08 PM
One of the biggest problems fitness clubs seem to have is communicating with their members in the right way at the right time. Since it directly impacts how many leads you get and how many become members, mapping out a communication strategy is essential for your gym’s growth.
In ASF and Club OS’s most recent episode of our webinar series,
Talk Data to Me
, lead conversions and communication tactics are exactly what hosts Sarah Pellegrino and Nick Hahn discussed. If you missed the latest episode, you can watch it or read our recap below to get their insider tips!
What is Your Lead-to-Member Conversion Rate?
Your lead-to-member conversion rate is the rate at which leads are becoming gym members. For example, if you have 100 leads and 10 sign up for your club, your conversion rate would be 10%. Lead to member conversion is an important
key performance indicator (KPI)
to track, as it allows you to gauge whether your marketing and sales tactics are working.
To get an accurate idea of your conversion rate, you should measure your leads and conversions within a specific period. Nick recommends 30 days as a good benchmark, as this is when you have the highest chance of converting new leads to members.
Lead-to-member conversion rates in the fitness industry are down in 2022 compared to 2021.
Compared to last year, the fitness industry’s lead-to-member conversion rates are trending downward. However, net new memberships have increased. That means that although a lower percentage of leads are becoming members, clubs are still bringing in more new members because they’re getting more leads.
Let’s say last July, your club brought in 10 leads, and four of them signed up for a membership. If your gym is following industry trends, then this July, you would’ve brought in 20 leads, but only seven of them became members. So, although your conversion
rate
last year was 40% and it’s only 35% this year, you still brought in three extra members.
What’s the catalyst behind this trend? Sarah points out that people are now shopping around for gyms—resulting in more leads. But there’s also much more competition—which is why fewer leads are converting.
The bad news for gym owners and operators is that the competition will only worsen. Between now and 2028, the fitness industry is
expected to grow by nearly 172%
. There is good news, though. You can continue attracting and converting leads by honing your communication strategy.

Communication is Key to Successfully Engage with Your Leads & Club Members
Communicating with your leads on a continuous but not too frequent schedule is essential for keeping them engaged with your gym. And engaging leads is vital to making them want to sign up for your club instead of someone else’s.
In the second half of the webinar episode, Nick and Sarah went over the top communication methods for gyms to use to nurture leads and engage with members, backed by some interesting data. Here are the insights they had:
Texting is the most successful communication method for driving conversions in 2022.
Traditionally, clubs use three methods to engage leads—text, email, and phone calls. Over the last few years, texting has become the best way to increase conversion rates. According to ASF and Club OS customer data, lead-to-member conversion rates for texting in 2022 are at 7-8%, compared to a little under 7% for phone calls and about 4% for email.
When speculating about why texting has become the best communication tactic, Nick points out that people who are searching your website and want to learn more about you but aren’t ready to join can be put off by a phone call. If they wanted to talk to someone, they would’ve called or booked a demo. Sarah compares it to that one friend who always calls right after you text them—don’t be that friend.
Texting them to schedule a tour, however, is a less aggressive way to give leads an opportunity to learn more about your club on their schedule.
Following up an unanswered text message with a phone call is more successful than following up with an email.
Although direct calls aren’t the best way to initially reach out to a lead, they can be a good way to follow up with them. This is because your prospects’ email inboxes have become oversaturated. How many emails do you delete from your inbox without even opening them? Leads are doing that too.
However, the timing of your phone calls is a significant factor in your success rate. Previously, the best time to reach a lead by phone was Monday morning, as people were just getting into the office and procrastinating the start of their workday at the coffee machine or in the lunchroom.
But in the current work-from-home world, Monday afternoons or Tuesday mornings are better times to call your leads.
Use email to send automated big-batch drip campaigns to leads.
Just because texting and calling are more effective than email at reaching leads and members doesn’t mean that email isn’t still a valuable communication tool. The key is to
use email the right way
.
Nick asserts that the best way to use email for engaging recently converted leads is to send automated brand emails as part of thoughtful drip campaigns. And the industry agrees that automation is one of the most effective email strategies, with
71% of marketers
reporting success. He suggests detailing a different service you offer in each email, tailored to each new member’s club activity.
For example, if the new member has been to the club four times within their first seven days of joining, email them about helpful club experience features like
mobile app check-in
. If they haven’t been in since they signed up, remind them to sign up for their free introductory personal training session. Either way, use these emails to show them you’re invested in their success.
Increase Lead to Member Conversions with Club OS Communication Tools
The lead-to-member conversion rate in the fitness industry may be decreasing, but that doesn’t mean it has to at your club too.
Club OS has the
easy-to-use communication tools
you need to nurture leads and continue engaging them when they become members. From automated texts and emails to targeted audience segmentation, we make it simple to follow up with every contact.

Talk Data to Me, Part III: The Value of Gym Member & Staff Loyalty Data
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:37:23 PM
Getting a new member to join your gym takes a lot of effort—and money. If that new member leaves after just a few months, then was it really worth expending those resources in the first place? Probably not.
Then how do you know whether your fitness business is truly growing? Or what’s driving that growth? And, if it’s not growing, where are your obstacles?
The answers to all those important questions lie in your
customer loyalty data
.
Customer loyalty data is information gathered directly from your members, prospects, and ex-members about what they think about your club. There’s a lot you can do with this data to make your business stronger and refine your gym member experience.
In the latest episode of the ASF and Club OS webinar series, Talk Data To Me, hosts Sarah Pellegrino and Nick Hahn talk all about customer loyalty data with Katie Bossie, a Senior Account Executive at
Listen360
, one of our partner brands. If you missed it, you can watch it below or keep reading to get the highlights!
The Benefits of Collecting Member Loyalty Data
Feedback from your club members is some of the most insightful data you can get your hands on. After all, who better to help you understand what your members like, dislike, and think about your gym than your members themselves?
To begin their discussion, Katie, Sarah, and Nick went over some of the things you can do with the power of customer loyalty data. Here are a few of the benefits they singled out:
Identify opportunities for improvement.
When you know what your members aren’t liking about their experience, you can be proactive about fixing those weak spots. That knowledge and your subsequent action can save you countless retained and future members (and dollars).
Retain at-risk members.
Those same insights about what customers don’t like and why they cancel allow you to address member concerns and recognize when someone might be preparing to leave. This gives you the chance to engage and delight them before they jump ship.
Take advantage of key strengths.
On the flip side, positive feedback from members will help you discover what you’re doing well and what makes your brand unique. You can use those strengths to your advantage in your positioning and messaging for marketing, prospect nurturing, and member retention.
Collect positive reviews.
95% of customers
read reviews before making a purchase. That makes reviews and testimonials from happy members one of your strongest tools for attracting and converting new members. You can also encourage those happy members to
refer you to their friends
.
The Benefits of Collecting Gym Staff Loyalty Data
As they continue to explore the benefits of having customer loyalty data, Sarah and Katie point out that it’s not just your member’s opinions you should be worried about.
How your employees feel about their experience at your club is just as important. And here’s why:
Retain more employees.
By asking for employee feedback, you can learn what aspects of your employee experience need improvement, what staff members are satisfied with, and what they want to see going forward. Whether it’s compensation and benefits or company culture, knowing what makes your staff loyal will inform what you need to focus on to
reduce turnover
.
Improve member loyalty.
Years of looking at loyalty data have taught Katie that employee loyalty directly predicts member loyalty. Why? Because happy, loyal staff members channel their satisfaction into the experiences they provide for members.
Refine your application process.
The collection of employee feedback doesn’t have to mean just your current employees—it can extend to your applicants too. Long and complex applications and interviews can put off potential applicants. With insight into the positives and negatives of these processes, you can adjust them to better attract and bring in the best industry talent.
How to Collect Gym Member & Staff Loyalty Data
So, now you know about the many different doors you can open when you collect member and employee loyalty data. And you know that those doors can lead to business growth and more profits.
Now, how do you get started?
The most efficient and effective way to collect loyalty data is using a net promoter-based feedback platform.
A feedback platform is a type of software that can integrate with your gym management system. It’ll automatically send out surveys you create to members, prospects, ex-members, employees, and others.
A net promoter-based platform is one that focuses on obtaining a net promoter score for your business. Listen360 is a net promoter-based feedback platform.
A net promoter score or NPS,
as defined by HubSpot
, is a customer satisfaction benchmark that measures how likely your customers are to recommend you to someone else. Individuals surveyed are given an NPS score on a scale of 1-10. Those individual scores from your customers are used to calculate your total NPS score on a scale of 1-100.
Essentially, Katie says, your NPS is a reflection of loyalty and a predictor of business growth.
When you’re using a tool like Listen360, NPS surveys are sent out automatically at key trigger points in the member journey.
You can create these surveys and set these trigger points. Common triggers include when a member checks in (not every time, but routinely), after they attend their first group fitness class, after a prospect takes a tour, and when a member cancels.
You can use Listen360 to create and send surveys to your employees too.
As surveys are filled out, you can review the loyalty data collected through a series of dashboards and reports that are updated in real-time. You’ll also receive a nightly email with these insights.
Katie suggests that gyms categorize their loyalty data using the Kano model.
The Kano model
is a method for understanding your club members’ preferences—as identified by your NPS data—and prioritizing them. It divides customer preferences into three categories:
Barriers
—Things your business must get right, or you can expect to see a decrease in member loyalty. Customers expect these, so they have no net positive impact on loyalty. An example would be the cleanliness of your gym.
Key Drivers
—Initiatives that, if done well, will have a net positive impact on loyalty. But if they’re not done well, they’ll have a negative impact on loyalty. An example would be the quality of a group fitness class.
Delighters
—Wow factors that are not expected but can generate a boost in loyalty. If you don’t have them, though, they won’t negatively impact loyalty because they’re not expected in the first place. An example would be a class pack giveaway.
Your customer loyalty data will shed light on whether you’re struggling with any barriers or key drivers. It’ll also highlight key drivers and delighters that are having a positive impact on loyalty.
From there, you’ll be able to determine where to focus your efforts to drive up your NPS—and with it, your club’s growth and revenue.

The Do’s And Don’ts of Gym Etiquette
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:39:29 PM
The gym is a place of community, which means all members should feel welcomed and comfortable. Most gyms and fitness clubs typically have specific rules, however there are unspoken guidelines members should be aware of. Here are some dos and don’ts of gym etiquette.
Here’s the Dos and Don’ts of Gym Etiquette
DO: PUT WEIGHTS BACK
Once you’re finished using free weights, always remember to put them back for safety and courtesy purposes. It’s not only dangerous to have heavy weights lying around but leaving them out implies that they are still in use. Be courteous and put weights back so other members can use the equipment. This applies especially during busy hours when members might have to take turns and wait for equipment.
DON’T: BLOCK SOMEONE’S VIEW OF THE MIRROR
Mirrors are definitely a hot spot in most gyms and can quickly become overcrowded, so although it might be difficult not to accidently block someone’s view during peak hours, try to avoid doing this at all. If this section of your gym is too crowded, exercise somewhere else and then come back to the mirror when space frees up.
DO: WIPE DOWN EQUIPMENT
How many of us enjoy working out in someone else’s sweat? No one, and gyms are not shy of germs. Although it’s not technically required and not a member’s responsibility to keep their gym clean, most gyms and fitness clubs have stations with cleaner and paper towels because it’s common courtesy to clean equipment. Remember to wipe down anything you touch. This includes treadmills, ellipticals, machine weights, free weights, even mats and foam rollers. Once you
learn more about gyms and germs,
you won’t think twice about wiping stuff down.
DON’T: SPEND HOURS ON ONE MACHINE
Unless you hit the gym when its dead, don’t spend hours on one machine. This is especially pertinent during peak hours when people might have to wait for machines. A good rule of thumb for cardio equipment is to spend no more than 30 minutes on these machines. When it comes to machine weights, don’t just sit and hang out on them. Do your reps, take small rests and then move onto the next thing.
This same concept applies to free weights as well. As we’ve reiterated before, use the weights you need and then put them back so someone else can use them. Spending hours on one machine also means that you aren’t exercising multiple muscle groups, which isn’t an effective workout anyway.
DON’T: MAKE WEIRD NOISES
There’s always one person at the gym who grunts during every rep. Don’t be that guy. It’s unnecessary and disrupts other people’s workouts. If you feel the need to scream, the weight is probably too heavy, and you might need to take it down a notch.
DO: HAVE GOOD HYGIENE
The gym is a place where most of us break a sweat and even though it doesn’t have to be the best-smelling place, nothing disrupts a workout like dreaded body odor. Do yourself and everyone else a favor by keeping up with good hygiene.
DON’T: SHOW OFF
Although you might be proud of your six pack and that you can bench press mass amounts of weight, other gym-goers don’t need or care to know. Every person at the gym is there to better themselves, no matter their size or how fast they can run. There’s a big difference between celebrating victories and showing off. Be proud of your own accomplishments, remember to do your own thing and also build up those around you.
DO: RESPECT OTHERS’ SPACE
This applies to really anywhere in your gym, but especially in hot spots like where there are mirrors, free weights, mats and stretching zones. It seems like common sense to mind your own space, but it can be difficult when the gym is crowded, so do as best as you can.
DON’T: DROP DUMBBELLS
Not only is this dangerous and can seriously hurt you or someone else, but it’s also disrespectful to your club’s equipment and is disruptive to other members. Just like with grunting and screaming at the gym, if you find yourself needing to drop dumbbells, the weight is too heavy. Drop the weight, not the dumbbells.
DON’T: LEAVE A GROUP CLASS EARLY
Unless you have a pressing emergency or legitimate reason to leave a group class early, it’s typically advised not to. Leaving a class early not only throws off other members in the class, but it’s inconsiderate to the instructor. Plus, if you paid for the class, it’d be a waste to not get your money’s worth.
DON’T: USE THE GYM AS YOUR PERSONAL PHOTO STUDIO
We are all familiar with the classic gym selfie, and although there’s nothing wrong with posting your workouts and fitness victories, the gym is not your personal photo studio. There’s nothing worse than someone hogging the mirror to snap selfies as other members are actually trying to use it during their workout. Take one, be done and move along with your workout.

When you run a gym, there are a lot of products on the market you’ll have to look at and decide whether they’re worth it for your business to invest in. Mobile fitness applications are one of those products that are climbing in popularity. But will a mobile app really make that much of a difference for you and your team?
The answer is a resounding yes.
In offering our new mobile app,
ASF Mobile
, we’ve learned a lot about and seen firsthand how a gym mobile app can benefit clubs, their members, and their employees. In the second article of our blog series, The Power of Mobile, we’re going to go over why a mobile app will be an advantageous tool for your team that boosts productivity and your bottom line.
1. Save Time
It’s no secret that a gym mobile app can
streamline your members’ club experience
. But something else to consider is how it can streamline your staff’s job duties too. Members can use your mobile app to check in for club visits, book classes, reserve equipment for classes, schedule training sessions, and buy session packs. Essentially, they can now take on many of the tasks that eat up your team members’ time.
A mobile app with these features will leave members feeling like they have more control over their fitness experience and have your staff spending less time behind a computer dealing with administration. This leaves them more opportunities to do the fun (and most important) part of their job —
building lasting relationships with club members
.
2. Personalize Member Interactions
Personalized conversations, communications, and club experiences make all the difference when it comes to member engagement and retention. After gyms shut their doors because of COVID,
36% of members reported
that they were looking forward to returning because they missed their gym’s sense of community. The more your team can do to make members feel like a valuable part of the club community, the longer they’ll stay.
But how does a mobile gym app help your staff interact with members on a more personal level? By giving them access to member data from integrations with fitness apps and wearables. When members connect their devices to your app to track their progress, trainers and other staff members can get a better idea of where they are on their fitness journey and where they want to go.
If a team member sees that a club member has been logging five runs on the treadmill per week, for example, they can recommend your gym’s upcoming running challenge or ask about their mile PR next time they visit. Insight from fitness data will also help employees customize things like workout suggestions, upsells, and more to deliver a better member experience.
3. Help Trainers Work More Efficiently
The best gym mobile apps are equipped with features that take your personal trainers’ success to a whole new level.
ASF Mobile
, for example, has pre-made workout templates and an extensive exercise library with over 1600 HD videos that can be used to quickly create customized workouts, which can then be sent to clients through the app. Trainers can also create personalized nutrition plans, chat with clients directly in-app, access client health data, and schedule training sessions.
All of these mobile app features help your trainers work faster, get their clients to their goals, and bring in more revenue. Considering that
42% of revenue
for varied gyms came from personal training in 2020, it’s safe to say that personal trainers are worth the investment.
4. Increase Sales
When it comes to sales, a mobile app is another asset that helps increase your bottom line. Having another selling point will make it easier for your staff members to
close the deal on new memberships
and bring in new leads. Perks from the app they can highlight include easy check-ins and bookings, workout resources, and efficient data tracking to help them hit their fitness goals. Some of these member perks even make it easier for customers to spend money, such as the ability to buy training sessions and packages right in the app.
With an extra tool to help boost sales, it might be a good idea to implement some sales-based incentives for employees to help with staff retention and increase revenue even more. You could offer commission for employees, for example, or run a sales competition each month with a prize or bonus for the highest seller. Your staff will stay motivated, and your bottom line will thank you.
Give Your Staff the Gift of ASF Mobile
The more tools you can offer your employees to make their job easier, the more successful your fitness business will be. The features you get with
ASF Mobile
will make your team feel like they have an extra employee on shift — a team member who tackles many of the time-consuming administrative tasks nobody wants to deal with.
ASF Mobile offers self-service check-in, class booking, session pack purchase, and other convenient tools that elevate members’ experience
and
save your team time and stress. Trainers can also use ASF Mobile to create and send clients personalized workout and nutrition plans, message clients, and track their progress.

The Power of Mobile: Must-Have Features for Your Club’s Mobile App
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:38:59 PM
Many of us live in a world ruled by mobile apps. From GPS to the news to your daily to-do list, there’s an app for everything and anything. For fitness clubs trying to get members to use their apps, that means you’re competing with millions of other companies for space on their phones and time in their days.
Considering that mobile apps lose
77% of their average users
within the first three days of download, it’s important that you get people hooked from the get-go. How do you do that? With the features they want and need.
In the third article of our blog series,
The Power of Mobile
, we’ll take a look at the top features your gym mobile app needs to have to attract, engage, and retain your users.
Easy Signup
A complicated or in-depth registration process is a turn-off for a majority of consumers. Think about how many times you were going to read an article online or order something from a social media ad, then were greeted with a lengthy form you didn’t feel like filling out. How many of those times did you just click right off the page? Probably most.
Fitness app users feel the same way about their signup process. Keep it short and simple, only asking for the basics. Limit the information you ask for to essentials like name, email, and phone number.
Progress Tracking
Tracking physical activity is tied with communicating with doctors as the
top reason consumers use mobile health and fitness apps
. If your gym’s app doesn’t let members view their fitness progress, they’re not going to be very engaged with it or your club.
Having a visual record of what they’ve accomplished so far helps members stay on top of their goals and identify when they need to adjust their routine. More importantly, progress tracking keeps them motivated to keep working out and using your app.
There are a lot of different metrics that can be tracked, and various fitness apps available to track different combinations. But it’s a good idea to keep your club’s app tracking to just a few of the most important metrics, so as not to overwhelm members with information. Steps taken, workouts completed, weight loss/gain, and calorie intake are the ones most users focus on.
Fitness App & Wearable Integrations
In 2021, there were
84 million fitness app users
. So, chances are high that your members are using more than one app to track their fitness progress. The ability to connect your gym’s mobile app with their other fitness apps and wearable devices will make it much easier for both members and trainers to track progress and access health data from your app.
Nobody wants to log their nutrition, workouts, or other fitness info twice—and if they’re already using another app, they’ll probably choose to stay with that one and leave yours behind. Quick and easy app and wearable syncing will allow for more accurate tracking within your gym app and increase its value. Users should be able to integrate with top apps like Apple Health, GoogleFit, MyFitnessPal, and so on.
Trainer Communication
Another function gym members are looking for out of club apps is the ability to connect with their personal trainers. It should be easy for personal training clients to communicate with their trainers through your app and vice versa. This gives them easy and direct access to their most valuable resource from your club to ask questions, seek support, and stay motivated.
Your app can also be a good way for trainers to send clients their workouts and reminders to complete them. Then, they can see their progress and hold them more accountable.
Booking & Scheduling
Two things all gym mobile apps should offer at their core are convenience and flexibility. The most apparent way to do that is with the ability for members to book classes and training sessions through your app, as well as securely pay for those bookings at the same time. In-app bookings are another way to add value to your app and persuade members to download and use it.
Allowing members to book classes and schedule PT sessions in the app is a benefit for your team members too. They can spend less time taking care of those tasks for members at the desk and spend more time engaging with people on the floor. Plus, the easier and more convenient it is to book classes, the more classes members will book, and the more revenue you’ll bring in.
Workout Video Tutorials
Although many people have returned to the gym since the coronavirus closures, a lot of them are still working out at home as well. In a
survey by SWNS Digital
, two out of three Americans said that the pandemic made them realize they don’t need a gym to stay fit. By offering workout video tutorials on your app, you can engage with those people still working out at home full or part-time, as well as your in-person members.
Video tutorials are
valuable content
you can offer to increase members’ perceived value of your app. Trainers can also use these videos as they create and send workouts to their clients to provide further guidance.
Offer Your Members More with ASF Mobile
Adding a mobile app to your club’s offerings doesn’t have to be expensive and time-consuming. When you use ASF’s club management software, you can offer members everything they need with
ASF Mobile
.
ASF Mobile empowers your members by letting them book classes, schedule and pay for sessions, and integrate their fitness apps. It also streamlines operations for your staff, freeing up their time and allowing them to engage with members on a more personal level through direct chat, data tracking, workout templates, and more.

The Truth About Eating Breakfast
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:39:10 PM
Whether you’re scrambling your eggs or scrambling to get out the door in the morning, at some point in your life, you’ve been told that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. The truth is that your mother didn’t lie to you all of those years, but have you ever wondered
why
it’s the most important meal of the day? Most Americans skip breakfast and many breakfast places don’t serve the healthiest or “ideal” options that give you all the benefits. According to
Livestrong
, there is an average eight to 12-hour time block between dinner the night before and breakfast the next day, which is why the word itself means that it’s the meal that’s supposed to break your fast. Here are some ways how breakfast can literally make your day sunny-side up and how even the busiest people can add it to their plate.
Why is Eating Breakfast Important?
HELPS TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY WEIGHT
When we suggest eating breakfast to maintain a healthy weight, that doesn’t mean to drench a giant stack of pancakes in a pool of maple syrup. Many of us skip it with the misconception that adding those extra calories to your daily diet will make you gain weight, when in fact, eating a balanced breakfast filled with essential nutrients will actually do the opposite.
According to
ABC News
, not only does breakfast boost your metabolism and help your body burn more calories throughout the day, but skipping it is actually a predictor of future weight gain and increases someone’s chances of becoming obese. A 12-year study that was presented at the Experimental Biology annual meeting in San Diego, California showed that people starting with a normal BMI who skipped breakfast ended with a larger waist circumference and saw the most overall weight gain. Simply put, this is because come lunch time, non-breakfast eaters feel deprived, which results in over-eating and poor food choices.
BOOSTS ENERGY AND CONCENTRATION
Just like how breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism, it also can boost your energy during workouts and help you focus throughout the day. Think of breakfast like power for your brain. It keeps you alert and aids in problem-solving skills, creativity and your attention span, according to Livestrong. If you don’t charge your body with the right foods first thing, then you won’t reap these wonderful possibilities.
HELPS WITH AN OVERALL HEALTHY DIET
Starting your day with something that fuels your body sets you up for success for the remainder of the day. Not only do you need nutrients like calcium, vitamins C and D, iron and fiber, but you’re much more likely to choose wisely come time for lunch and dinner if you’ve already filled your body with a nutritious breakfast. This applies especially if you’re someone who works out in the morning. Livestrong says that ultimately, lack of breakfast equals lack of daily needed nutrients.
WHAT KINDS OF BREAKFAST FOODS SHOULD YOU ACTUALLY EAT?
WHAT IF YOU’RE ON THE GO?
For us busy folks who don’t usually have time to fill up a plate Monday through Friday, packing our breakfasts the night before is usually our saving grace. According to
Healthline
, coffee without all of the added cream and sugar is one of the best things you can start your day with because of the caffeine. Aside from the obvious pick-me-up, it can enhance your mood and help your metabolism. If you’re someone who absolutely needs to sweeten your coffee, try using skim milk with a little bit of real sugar. If you’re not a coffee drinker, sip on some fresh green tea with honey. Green tea contains an antioxidant known as EGCG, which helps protect the brain, heart and nervous system.
When it comes to food, many of us get in the habit of quickly grabbing a granola bar on our way out the door thinking it’s healthy but are unaware of all the added sugars. Healthline says that eggs are one of the best things you can eat for breakfast. They’re packed with good fats and protein, which help keep you fuller longer and can reduce calorie intake during lunch and dinner. Instead of rushing to cook eggs in the morning, make hard boiled eggs the night before and take one with you in the morning.
For cereal lovers, start your day with good carbs like a half cup of plain instant oatmeal. Sweeten it up by squeezing some raw honey on there, add a dash of cinnamon, and pack it in your gym or work bag. For extra sugar and antioxidants, add some fresh fruit like blueberries or strawberries. For more good fats, add raw walnuts or almonds. According to Healthline, nuts are a great addition to breakfast because they are filling and help prevent weight gain. If you’re not someone who likes any of these options, grab a banana and a spoonful of peanut butter for potassium and a quick protein fix.

[Video] Using Software to Engage the Modern Fitness Consumer
Posted by
Club OS
on Dec 20, 2023 12:28:10 AM
As part of
DISRUPT 2023
, Athletech News facilitated a panel moderated by Sarah Pellegrino, Host of the
Value Proposition
for The Fitness Business Podcast, and featuring Nick Hahn, vice president of product for
Club OS
& ASF, and Jarrod Saracco, president & founder of
Health Club Doctor
, to dive into these topics and help operators understand how to meet the needs of the modern fitness consumer – and your facility – through automation.
Gyms and studios must leverage digital marketing tools and automation features to be successful in the
modern era
This article is part of ATN’s
DISRUPT 2023
video series, which features key conversations with executives from the most successful brands in fitness and wellness. To watch more videos, click

These days, if fitness facilities don’t automate consumer engagement and marketing they will be left behind. That much is clear. But it’s not enough to simply set up a text or phone call cadence and some all-purpose messaging and call it a day. Not by a long shot.
On the marketing end, obtaining useful data, and then synthesizing and utilizing it appropriately is where the rubber meets the road. Understanding the nuances of the numbers and using them to your advantage and toward meeting your audiences’ needs is marketing 101.
This sounds obvious, but if you don’t have the right platform or the right support, this piece can become convoluted, making your automation investment a waste of money and time.
Know Your Audience
When it comes to communication, it must be personalized and customized to the recipient. This encompasses not only the messaging itself but the means used to facilitate it.
“Generation Z and Millennials make up 75% of gym members, and this demographic works off of their phone at all times,” Hahn said. “You must communicate with this group via text, and offer them the ability to schedule classes, training sessions and conduct any engagement with your facility via their
mobile devices.”
Clubs must also
categorize communication
differently between new members, existing members, and alumni.
“There is a whole different set of communication needs that a new member has and it’s nearly impossible to communicate with them without automation,” Hahn noted. “You must be able to track and understand their action within the facility – what classes they take, what items they purchase, what smoothies they consume, etc. – so you can personalize their journey and move them from a new member to a member who has incorporated you into their lifestyle.”
“Conversely, less is more when it comes to alumns,” Hahn cautions. “These folks know your brand and what you offer and have either moved on because of a lifestyle change or because they are dissatisfied. Providing them well-spaced updates to let them know what’s new or different since they’ve last been there is the best approach,” he says. Saracco agrees, saying, “Messaging must stem from who you are as a facility, and then address the unique needs of the
specific consumer.”
The Must-Haves
When asked what software features are most important, Saracco first points to customization.
“Every business is different. I want a system that can be set up based on my needs, not the needs of the facility down the street, or the huge club chain that
operates
completely differently than I do,” he said.
“Also important is versatility,” he notes. “The system must be able to communicate with different audience groups, as we’ve talked about, and it must have the ability to integrate with my other marketing items such as email newsletters.”
“My other priorities are support and training.
I’m
not going to partner with a company that leaves me to figure it out on my own,” Saracco adds.
Navigating the Numbers
Getting lost in the reports or making business decisions in a vacuum is a common pitfall that operators may need
help avoiding.
“The numbers can lie,” Hann says. “Meaning they can tell whatever story you want to hear, so it’s important to look at numbers within context.” He gives closing rates as an example. “If you don’t hit your desired number here, maybe your appointment bookings are down. For every measure you need to look at the counter-measure to understand the whole story and decide on the best actions to take.”
“My favorite example of this is cancellations,” says Saracco. “An owner or operator may panic over 100 cancellations, but out of that 100, there are people who have moved, passed away, changed their lifestyle, etc. A good software partner will work with you to determine what’s important to track, and how to holistically dig into the numbers to uncover
meaningful insights.”
In the end, Saracco says a tech partner should truly act as an extension of the business and understand its operations.
“I want certain KPIs tracked that may be different than other gyms’ KPIs,” he says. “I want flexibility in the system to completely align with my business. And I want ongoing support. That’s why I chose Club OS and ASF. They understand the uniqueness of my business and my needs and partner with me accordingly.”

What a Sweaty Workout Actually Means
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:39:25 PM
You’re
at the gym running on a treadmill and can’t help but notice that you’re dripping in sweat
, constantly wiping your face off, but the person next to you isn’t even glistening a drop of moisture. Because you’ve probably been in a scenario like this more than once, you might beg the questions: Does sweating more mean a better workout? If I sweat a lot when I work out, does that mean I’m out of shape?
If I don’t sweat enough, does that mean I’m not trying hard enough
? What does this all mean?
According to
Daily Burn
, we automatically think that more sweat equals how many calories we’ve burned. Not to burst your bubble, but if you are that person on the treadmill dripping in sweat, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re getting a better workout compared to the person running next to you. In other words, calories burned does not directly correlate with the amount you sweat because there are too many factors that play into why our bodies do what they do when we work out. Here are some of the factors that can explain that.
Why Do Some People Sweat More Than Others?
BODY TYPE
Whether you’re at a healthy weight or you’re overweight, both body types will sweat on some level during exercise because when the body gets too hot, it naturally produces sweat to cool itself off. According to
POP Sugar
, someone who is overweight will most likely sweat more because more body fat generates more heat. So, on some level, yes, if someone is out of shape, they are more likely to produce more sweat when they are physically active, but that doesn’t necessarily mean their workouts are “better” or “worse.” POP Sugar also says that fit people actually sweat more at the beginning of workouts because their bodies are quicker at adjusting to the amount of heat generated, which allows for a faster cool-down.
ENVIRONMENT
Have you ever noticed when it’s really humid somewhere that you’re sweating a lot more? Or you might be working out in your gym and after a while, you feel really hot and notice how much you’re sweating, and then realize the fans or air conditioning aren’t turned on? That’s not a coincidence. That’s because your body is cooling itself down because the environment is too hot.
This is the same reason as to why you might see more runners outside early in the morning and in the evening because it’s cooler out. They’ll still break a sweat because running will raise their body temperatures, but it’s much more comfortable to work out where it’s cooler, and most likely, those people aren’t sweating as much compared to if they were running during a time when the sun is blasting. So next time you’re at the gym, don’t be fooled by how much you’re sweating–simply focus on doing a solid workout, no matter how much your body perspires.
THE TWO G’s– GENDER AND GENETICS
Some people just sweat more–plain and simple, and that can be because of family history, or because someone has more sweat glands. For instance,
CNN
says that younger people typically sweat more than older people. According to
POP Sugar
, we are born with between two and four million sweat glands. Women have more sweat glands than men, but men’s sweat glands are more active than women’s. Even if you’re a woman and you sweat a lot when you work out, don’t be alarmed. It could be because of family history or because you just have more active sweat glands. Unless you sweat a lot while at rest, there’s nothing to worry about.
WHAT YOU’RE WEARING
This is why you don’t wear a winter coat while you’re lifting weights. POP Sugar says to refrain from wearing synthetic fabrics because they trap in more heat and will generate more sweat. According to
CNN
, if you wear heavy cotton shirts, you’ll likely notice that sweat stains will linger as opposed to if you are wearing more breathable fabric, because your sweat gets trapped and doesn’t evaporate as quickly. Again, if you notice your t-shirt is drenched, don’t just assume your workout is “better,” because it could also just be what you’re wearing.
HOW YOU’RE FEELING
Have you ever gone to the gym to “work off some steam,” and you actually noticed more steam coming out of you? Ironically enough, whether you’re angry, stressed or nervous, all of those emotions can generate sweat because they raise your heart rate and trigger a rush of hormones, causing your body to heat up. If you’re also new to your gym and are feeling a little intimidated by it, you might sweat more because of the fact that you’re nervous.
HYDRATION
Hydration is surprisingly something that we often misinterpret when it comes to our sweat rates. Most people know to bring a water bottle to the gym with them because they need to stay hydrated, but if you drank a whole bottle of water before hitting the gym, you’re probably going to sweat more due to the higher amount of fluids in your system. Going back to our main point, you could be doing moderate exercise and sweating more, merely because of the fact that you’re more hydrated than usual.
People also mix up water weight when it comes to weight loss. In this case especially, sweat is not your “fat crying.” Most of it is actually all of the water you drank being released. After an intense workout, you’re most likely extra sweaty because you pushed yourself really hard, but you probably also drank a lot of water during that time to balance the two out. You may have also stepped on a scale after that and saw that the number decreased, thinking you lost weight, when in fact, you just lost water and that’s exactly why the number on the scale is always fluctuating by a couple of pounds, because we are always losing and gaining water.
IN CONCLUSION
The ultimate misconception with a little or a lot of sweat is weight loss. It seems like common sense to assume that the more you sweat, the more weight you’re losing, but that is actually false. Because we associate sweat with exercise, we also assume that sweat is how “weight” leaves the body during the weight-loss process. To get down to it, weight loss is different than fat loss.
According to POP Sugar, weight loss is the actual number on the scale that went down, which could be a result of many things, like water loss for instance. Fat loss is how much body fat we lose. Even though someone who is overweight may sweat more, it doesn’t mean they are dropping fat. Some of that fat loss is released in the form of sweat, but the majority of it is actually breathed out, according to the
Huffington Post
.
Because of the idea, “energy in, energy out,” we have the misconception that fat and weight is expelled through sweat when the majority of it actually goes into thin air. When you think of burning calories, you’re not burning calories through your sweat. That fat and those calories are being converted into carbon dioxide as they exit your body. That’s also another huge reason why we refer to the experience of weight loss as a “journey,” because it doesn’t happen overnight due to how much carbon dioxide we have to exert in order to lose those extra pounds.

What Do Sore Muscles Actually Mean?
Posted by
Club OS
on May 12, 2025 2:39:21 PM
If you’ve ever worked out a day in your life, you’ve probably experienced the feeling before. You know when you try to sit down in a chair, then get back up and you can barely move your legs? Or when you’ve worked your arm and back muscles really hard and can barely put shampoo in your hair while taking a shower? But, what do sore muscles actually mean?
That’s the kind of pain we are talking about, and many people refer to it as “good pain” because we associate muscle soreness with how effective our workouts are. It’s the same idea we have about the relationship between sweating and exercise, and although it’s easy to assume that the sorer you are from a workout, the better it was, the two do not always go hand and hand. Here is what that stiffness actually means.
TEARING AND REACTION OF SORE MUSCLES
That common stiffness many people experience a couple of days after an intense sweat session is known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, or DOMS for short. According to
Daily Burn
, the soreness kicks in about eight hours after, with a peak time of typically 24 to 48 hours after a tough workout. DOMS is the technical term for the reaction of your muscles tearing and adjusting to new physical activity. Think of your soreness (DOMS) as your muscles preparing your body for future activity. While this can mean that a workout was effective and does mean your muscles are growing and responding, it does not mean you can’t see growth without it.
LESS PAIN, MORE GAIN
We love this kind of pain because we’ve been told over and over that it’s equivalent to gaining muscle.
SWEAT Instructor, Kayla Itsines
says that while this definitely holds some truth, we fall under the trap that gains are nothing without pain. She advises to stop confusing a challenging workout with muscle pain,
because when it comes to seeing results
, they are different. What it comes down to is recovery time, which is something many of us only think about when we experience DOMS.
Take this scenario: you’ve gotten in the groove of a new workout routine. At the beginning, you felt muscle soreness all of the time, but a few months later, you’re doing the same workout, and the soreness has either worn off or is completely gone. In this case, you’re not challenging your body enough anymore.
Your muscles got used to the amount of weight you’ve been lifting which means you can now lift heavier weight. Often times people look at this in a negative way because they aren’t feeling the “pain” part, and it’s very easy to come to the conclusion of “no pain, no gain,” but what it actually means is that you are now stronger because you’re experiencing less DOMS and your muscles are able to recover quicker.
According to
Vitals
, DOMS is the worst at the beginning of a workout routine. So, if you’re someone who just started a fitness program or going to the gym and your muscles are on fire, it’s because your muscles are trying to adjust. Vitals also says results are not actually visible until DOMS fades or no longer happens. If you’re new to working out, pay attention down the road to when you see a little bicep build or when your abs start to play peek-a-boo. It typically occurs when you experience little to no muscle soreness.
People who train infrequently or at random intensity levels often experience more soreness but see little or irregular growth. Simply put, this is because muscles aren’t sure how to react, so they can’t grow properly if there’s no consistency. Instead of focusing so much on feeling the good burn, think about your overall fitness improvements.
ASK YOURSELF THESE QUESTIONS:
Can you lift heavier weight and do more reps than when you started?
Are you able to push through a tough workout better than you used to?
Are you becoming more toned?
Do your clothes feel looser?
If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, then your fitness levels are improving
regardless
of muscle soreness.
BOTTOM LINE
The more you train, the less soreness you’ll feel, and vice versa. This doesn’t mean, however, that people who train more don’t experience DOMS. It also doesn’t necessarily mean that if you experience DOMS all of the time that you’re out of shape, because it also depends on the person. A safe rule of thumb to follow is to think of soreness as a result of your muscles reacting to something they’re not used to–this goes for everyone, whether you’re a body builder or a gym virgin.
You could be someone who works out five days a week, doing a mix of interval cardio and heavy weight-lifting, but maybe one day you decide to try a barre class. A couple days later, you’re most likely going to feel the effects of that barre class because you worked different muscles or the same muscles in different ways and your body is adapting to it.
If you’re a regular gym-goer, DOMS typically won’t be as intense and will last for shorter periods of time compared to someone who occasionally hits the gym or goes on a hike once in a while. In a nutshell, try to exercise regularly and pay attention to when workouts become too easy or are too difficult. You can still love that “good pain,” just don’t rely on it as an overall fitness test.

Don’t get me wrong, both those things are really important, but just focusing on them alone won’t make your members stay.
Some gym and studio owners overlook the fact that you need to have a clear strategy for retention that every staff member in your fitness business understands. It needs to be embedded into the day to day of how your business operates.
But before this can happen you need to know what makes a great retention strategy. As we have said, while it’s important to be friendly and welcoming to a member, there is so much more to it. You have to think of your retention strategy in terms of the journey your member goes on.
From the moment they step in the door there needs to be a pathway they can follow to achieve the best results they can. And, you need to have protocols on place if you find that member straying from this path.
In this article we will go into why a good member retention strategy is so important and explore 10 membership best practices you aren’t doing.
Skip ahead to: {table_of_contents]
Why is a Good Membership Retention Strategy so Important?
With the
changing landscape of the fitness industry
, especially in the last few months, it’s important to reflect on your retention strategy. As many brands have pivoted to a
hybrid fitness business
, your retention strategy needs to encompass this move in a way that allows you to deliver excellent customer service and member experience online and offline.
An excellent membership retention strategy is at the heart of a buzzing and successful fitness business. It’s in everything from your onboarding strategy to the way you interact with your members at every point in the sales journey. Member retention is about more than just increasing the bottom line, it’s creating a stellar experience that not only retains members but attracts new ones. You need a systemized process strategy that takes a stranger to a paying and loyal member.
Here are a few key reasons why it’s important.
Improve Your Rate of Growth
Increasing your membership retention rate can improve your rate of growth. With a more consistent member base, you’re more likely to develop meaningful relationships between members and staff. This can drastically improve the member experience as deeper connections help to create more personal interactions.
New Members Cost More
It costs about
five times as much to attract a new customer
instead of keeping an existing one. To build a successful business, you need to develop a base of loyal customers who renew their membership. If you put all your focus on attracting new members instead of nurturing your current ones, you will start to see your bank balance drop. Your existing members are incredibly valuable.
Increase Your Bottom Line
Statistics suggest that increasing your customer retention rate by 5% can result in an
increase in profits by 25% to 95%
. There’s a massive potential to increase your bottom line. Improving your retention rate not only boosts your bottom line but increases the entire member experience.
More Referrals from Loyal Members
Loyal members are happy members. Happy members are much more likely to refer your business. When you
increase your retention rate
, you may see an improvement in word of mouth marketing. Your members are your best brand cheerleaders and can do wonders for your business.
10 Best Membership Retention Practices for Your Business
Your membership retention strategy starts well before a member has walked through the door. In reality, there’s an entire process that takes place from the first touchpoint to a fully-fledged and paying member. The best retention practices think about every step of the customer journey and make data-driven decisions to drive value. Let’s break down 11 retention practices you can implement in your business.
1. Discover Why Members Joined
The longer you retain members, their lifetime value increases and they bring in more money to your business in the long-term. If you don’t have a good retention strategy in place, you’ll always be on the lookout for new members.  In general, people join your gym or fitness studio for a reason. Maybe it’s to lose some weight, make new friends, or they love the classes you run.
Whatever the reason, find out what it is and continue to deliver on it. Stay true to your promise. The majority of members tend to lose motivation when they aren’t seeing results. Do what it takes to keep members consistent and hitting their goals. Keeping members motivated is a big part of retaining members.
2. Design Your Onboarding Process to Encourage Member Retention
The onboarding process plays an integral role in maximizing your retention strategy. It helps to ensure new members turn into loyal ones who continue to use your services and engage with your business. When it comes to member onboarding, there isn’t a blanket approach that fits everyone. You may be speaking to someone who has never stepped foot in a gym or perhaps an individual who is an avid gym-goer but is switching facilities. Each person needs a tailored approach during the onboarding journey.
Your team needs to be able to identify members that need the most support and provide the correct resources. By asking the right questions to new members, you can figure out the right onboarding plan for them and begin to nurture customer loyalty from the very beginning of the relationship.

3. Understand Member Churn
Your member churn, or attrition rate, is the nemesis of member retention. There are reasons that are out of your control as to why members may leave such as moving away or a change in financial situation. However, you can actively reduce member retention by fully understanding why your members leave.
The fitness industry is becoming increasingly technology-centered, so use that to your advantage. Maybe a member missed their monthly goal and then stopped attending classes the following week. If you know that motivation is a big factor in member churn, think about ways to hold members accountable and keep them motivated.
4. Offer Solutions and Drive Value
For many businesses, it’s now more important than ever to retain existing members. With the COVID-19 pandemic, many fitness brands pivoted to a digital fitness offering. They were able to continue to drive value to members, despite closing their doors. Providing added value to your members is a good retention practice.
The majority of people are looking for a solution to a problem. When you want to lose weight, the main obstacles tend to be nutrition and exercise. If you package solutions that solve problems, they are so valuable. Maybe you provide nutrition consultation and meal plans as additional services. When you combine digital and in-person services, you can offer solutions and really drive value to members.
5. Personalize the Experience
Personalization isn’t new to the scene, however, it has been developing in the last few years. A key part of a businesses’ success is that it can keep customers coming back again and again. Technology makes it easier than ever to personalize the member experience. Address your members by their names in all forms of communication and use technology to personalize the fitness experience.
When you speak directly to your customers, it makes them feel special. Members are more likely to pay attention to your communication channels if you address them directly. It also helps to develop a closer relationship between your business and members. The aim is to create meaningful personal connections both online and offline.
6 . Engage with Members
A great retention strategy creates an engaging customer experience. To do this, you need to map the customer journey. This means getting the touchpoints right. You want to engage with people throughout the member lifecycle but you don’t want to constantly bombard them with your sales messaging. It will quickly disengage members and end up having the opposite of the desired effect.
To map out your touchpoints, think about the customer journey from the beginning of the sales process onwards. You want to find what your members expect at each stage and what kind of emotions they will be experiencing. When you combine this with your communication strategy, you can create an engaging environment that nurtures members. The last thing you want to do is keep pushing a message either too often or to the wrong person. For further insight, listen to the retention guru, Dr. Paul Bedford, who explores the topic of
retention now and in the future
on the Fitness Founders Podcast.
7. Leverage Data and Technology
Technology can have a big impact on retention in the fitness industry. With advances in technology, you now have access to a ton of data that was previously untouchable. Membership management solutions give you the opportunity to access data that gives you an edge when it comes to member retention. It allows you to develop early intervention strategies and make better decisions. This leads to happier and more engaged members.
Early intervention is a massive contributor to member retention. You don’t need to wait until a member hands in their notice. You can step in early on in the customer journey to prevent future member churn. For example, if you have a member who attends a class every Wednesday and religiously goes to the gym at the weekend and you notice a change in their behavior, you need to question it. Missing classes and regular workout sessions is a signal that a member is losing motivation. Take the opportunity to follow up and make sure everything is going well. Maybe you could offer a personal training session or free meal plan to help a member get back on track.
8. Automate the Renewal Process
Another way to use technology to your advantage is to automate the membership renewal process. The last thing you want is for a member to slip through your fingers because of forgetfulness. Gym management software will save you hours of time by automating tasks that benefit your business.
You can automate the whole renewal process by sending out automatic emails to members a week or so before their renewal period. Make it as easy as possible to renew memberships and manage their account. By including different payment options and automating invoicing, a simple booking and renewal process is part of the
digital fitness experience
.
9. Deliver Excellent Customer Service
Excellent customer service and experience go hand-in-hand. Great customer service helps to boost sales and member retention. A positive attitude and the ability to go above and beyond for your customers helps to provide the kind of service people are willing to pay for.
Your customer service will help to build your reputation, increase word of mouth marketing, and improve the overall value of your business. Although it may sound obvious that good customer service is part of a good retention strategy, it’s so important. Consistently delivering fantastic customer service will create happy and loyal members.
10. Send an Exit Survey to Members
Gaining and losing members is part of the business. If someone does choose to leave you, take the time to find out why. Use the moment as a learning experience so that it doesn’t happen again. Some members leave for valid reasons, however, you could step in to stop others leaving.
If early intervention strategies have failed you, it’s still a good idea to find out the reasons why a member has left. Surveys are a great way to find out information directly from both your existing and previous members. You can also send out surveys to existing members to find out any pain points or potential reasons someone may quit. Your members are an incredible source of data. Use that data to step in and change the situation before you lose a customer.
In Summary
As your business evolves and develops, your retention strategy needs to reflect those changes. In the fitness industry, member retention will always be important. It’s essential that you create a solid retention plan that nurtures and engages members. Use data to intervene early on, create a watertight onboarding process, and transform your retention strategy.

7 Ways Gym Apps Benefit Members
1. Access to Personalized Training Programs
One of the biggest benefits of gym apps is their ability to provide members with personalized training programs. Users can input their fitness goals, exercise preferences, and any injuries or health conditions, and the fitness app will generate a customized workout plan that suits their needs. This personalization level is impossible with traditional gym routines or generic workout plans.
In addition, with gym mobile apps, members can access their training program anytime from anywhere, making it easier to stick to their fitness goals. So, whether they’re traveling or have a busy schedule, they can follow their customized training plan wherever they are, thanks to the convenience of gym mobile apps.
2. Nutritional Advice
Another great advantage of fitness apps is their ability to give users easy access to
nutritional advice
. Many gym mobile apps offer features like meal planning, calorie tracking, and nutritional tips that help users make healthier choices. Generally, these apps can track your members’ food intake and provide recommendations based on their dietary requirements to ensure they’re getting the right nutrients to support their long-term fitness goals.
3. Workout Tracking and Monitoring
Another benefit of fitness apps is that they allow your members to track and monitor their progress. Members can log their workouts, follow their progress, and get feedback on their performance. This feature helps your members stay motivated and provides them with the information they need to adjust their training plan as they progress.
4. Motivation and Support
There are many motivational benefits to gym mobile apps. For example, some apps have a social component that allows members to connect with others who share their fitness goals. As a result, members can share their progress, encourage each other, and get advice from others who have been through similar experiences.
5. Flexibility and Convenience
There’s no question that fitness apps provide members with flexibility and convenience, enabling them to work out whenever and wherever they want. In addition, users can access their workout plans and nutritional advice anytime, allowing them to work out on their schedule.
6. Variety and Fun
In addition to flexibility and convenience, gym mobile apps offer a range of workout options, providing members access to various exercise routines and styles. Users can choose from strength training, cardio, yoga, and more, allowing them to mix up their workouts and avoid getting bored. Some apps also offer on-demand workouts and live classes, making workouts more enjoyable and engaging.

4 Ways Gym Apps Benefit Your Business
Selling merchandise at your gym is a no-brainer when it comes to increasing your overall profits. You can offer members a variety of options such as t-shirts, water bottles, gym bags, or supplements. You can also create limited edition items to encourage members to make a purchase. Additionally, you can promote your merchandise through social media, email marketing, or in-person at your gym. By selling merchandise, you can increase revenue, build your brand reputation, enhance member engagement and grow your profits all at the same time.
1. Gain more clients
From a business perspective, gym mobile apps can help you gain more clients by making it easier for potential customers to discover and learn about your gym. With an app, you can showcase your services, pricing, and class schedules, making it easier for people to find and join your gym. You can also use the app to offer exclusive promotions and discounts to first-time customers to encourage them to sign up.
2. Improve your clients’ experience
Another benefit of gym mobile apps is that they can help you improve your members’ experience by offering features that make it easier for them to achieve their fitness goals. For example, you can use the app to create and manage personalized training programs, track clients’ progress, and offer nutritional advice. You can also use the app to communicate with your members and offer them the motivation and support they need to keep them on track with their goals.
3. Promote your brand
In addition, gym apps can help you promote your brand by offering a platform to showcase your gym’s unique features and services. You can use the app to share customer success stories, post photos and videos of your gym and classes, and offer exclusive promotions to app users. By promoting your brand through an app, you can reach a wider audience and build a strong online presence for your gym.
4. Upsell your products and services
Finally, gym mobile apps can help you upsell your products and services by offering customers an easy and convenient way to purchase additional items. For example, you can offer fitness apparel, supplements, or personal training sessions through the app, allowing customers to easily browse and purchase items from their mobile device. You can also use the app to promote events or special classes and sell tickets or sign-ups directly through the app.

.
Fitness apps are an easy and accessible way to stay fit on the go or work out from home. In this article, we’ll talk about the best fitness apps your members need to download to get them moving and support their gym routine.
How Mobile Apps Are Transforming Health and Fitness
The market is flooded with numerous apps that offer different benefits. From helping you to lose weight and tone up to improving your sleep and monitoring your food intake, there’s an app out there for all things health and fitness. Apps encourage members to get moving, hold them accountable and help to achieve their goals.
Monitor Workout Routines and Goals
Many of your members may live a sedentary lifestyle, whether they work in an office or have little time for themselves throughout the day. Fitness apps help users to set up realistic goals that are completely achievable. By taking into account a user’s height, weight, fitness level, and overall goal, they can help to set achievable goals in a certain timeframe.
As well as setting goals, fitness apps can monitor your workout routines. Track how often you’ve been to the gym this week and what you focused on, so you can see what you need to do next. Apps can store your personal workout history, monitor everything from calorie intake and your workout to how much quality sleep you get. The ability to connect to wearables like Fitbit and Apple Watch makes it an effortless task to track metrics, allowing users to stay on top of their workout program and reach their goals.
Stay Connected with a Community
Apps help users to stay connected and find encouragement from a community of like-minded individuals all trying to reach the same goals. Fitness apps work to create a sense of competition with leaderboards and scoring. If your members like to work out alone but thrive with an element of competition, then fitness apps support them and push them to work harder to beat out the competition. While fitness pursuits can certainly be a solo affair, finding a sense of community can actually go a long way when it comes to consistency and longevity. Whether that means a physical workout buddy or a virtual one, finding people with similar goals and interests can really help with motivation and inspiration. Most
gym management software
providers now provide an app that allows them to stay connected to their gym at all times.
The 15 Best Exercise and Fitness Apps
A whole category of health and fitness apps strive to make you fitter and healthier. By taking advantage of today’s information-rich technology, apps focus on bringing personalized trainer-built workouts right to your fingertips. Whether you want a quick yoga flow in the morning before heading out to work or want to pump out a HIIT routine, apps help to push members to get moving.
Fitness apps stress consistency in a healthy lifestyle and hold you accountable while offering up a variety of exercises that you may not have experienced before. Here are some of the best fitness apps on the market you need to download.

Glofox have put together three key areas for focus, if you’re thinking of opening a CrossFit Box in the near future.
1. Create a Business Plan
Often, CrossFit owners assume their passion and optimism is enough to build a successful fitness business. Others say they were too busy to create a
CrossFit business plan
. However, running a business without a plan can prove even more time-consuming in the long run.
Take the time to sit down, research and develop this plan in full pre start up, in an attempt to help
transition from a trainer to a business owner mindset
. In order to run a successful CrossFit gym, you need to acknowledge this new terrain and start thinking like an owner. It’ll take some getting used to but just like with your fitness regimen, perseverance will get you through.
2. Be Different
CrossFit now have over 7000 affiliate gyms, with boutique chains adding new studios at a rate of 450% a year since 2010. The explosion of the micro gym trend doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. With the intensity of competition as it is, there’s no room for clone CrossFit boxes, but there is plenty of room for those who decide to stand out from the crowd and make themselves that little bit different.

Map out how you’re CrossFit is going to be different
from others. Ask yourself questions like; What makes my CrossFit business unique? Why would somebody train at my CrossFit gym as opposed to the gym up the road? Once you identify a unique selling point, believe in your idea and develop a plan for implementation. Set a vision for your CrossFit gym and make small steps towards achieving this vision each and every day. Try not to fall into the trap of price and aesthetics, focus on goals and
the community aspect
.
3. Make Things Personal
Show interest in your client’s fitness journey. We’re not talking about being nosy, but simply conveying your undying passion for CrossFit, fitness and of course, your clients. Start as you mean to go on and show exactly how much drive your CrossFit community shares.
Spend time with each new client
whether it be 10 minutes or 30 minutes, depending on the size of your CrossFit gym. Take the time to sit down and explain what it is exactly your CrossFit prides itself in. Tell the client what to expect over the coming weeks and ensure they have realistic expectations in terms of their fitness goals. Establishing this relationship ensures that your members trust to come to you if they have any questions or issues, giving you the chance to
retain customers
who may have otherwise just walked away without an explanation.

You’re in luck! Today we spoke with TRX Master Trainer and owner of
Kickstart Fitness, Darren Dillon
to bring you top tips for a great TRX class.
Darren Dillon’s 3 Tips for a Great TRX Class
1. Be Passionate
You may be an extremely intelligent and well educated trainer, but if the passion and energy is not there you’re not going to have the ability to
motivate and captivate your clients
. Without motivation, clients will not be encouraged to persevere and achieve their goals and we all know what that means – an empty studio, something which is detrimental to a fitness business. Avoid declining attendance rates by ensuring your trainers’ energy and passion for fitness permeates the studio.
2. Take Safety Seriously
Safety should always remain at the heart of any exercise class and the greatest piece of advice Darren offers is to avoid learning the hard way and instead, to purchase authentic equipment from day one. Trustworthy equipment is crucial around the safety and well being of clients. No matter what equipment you require, whether it be weights, suspension trainers or even educational resources, ensure you are dealing with authentic companies, such as TRX; there’s a reason why such brands are leaders in their field.

3. Be Available
It’s easy to take on so much that you end up with little spare time to really interact with your clients. In reality, the last thing your clients want to see is their trainer running from class to class quicker than you could say “TRX suspension training”. Yes, you want to have as many classes running and as many people coming through the door as possible. However, it is vital that you do not lose sight of the reason why you started this business in the first place: People. Don’t leave your clients feeling neglected,
engage, interact and encourage
them on their fitness journey. Darren recommends waiting even 2 minutes at the end of each class to answer any questions clients may have. This time is crucial to building lasting relationships. On another positive note, every lasting relationship may lead to a referral!

You’ve built a website that shares your vision, your methods and you have the social proof to back it up, but it’s not working out as the revenue generating machine that you hoped? Marketing and sales may not be your favorite topic, but it
doesn’t
have to be a barrier hindering your fitness business success.
What’s next?
You need to give your website visitors the option to take the action they want to take, when they want to take it. Providing a phone number or email address simply isn’t enough. Your clients expect more.
We Live in an Era of Self Serve and
“i Want It Now”.
When a visitor clicks “Book Now” on your website, they expect an instant booking option, not to be directed to a phone number, email address or “contact us” form. By giving prospects the option to buy exactly in the moment when they’re ready to do so, you’re guaranteed to capture a segment of users who otherwise, would have been lost.
Let’s start by taking a look at the current user experience on your website. Here are a few questions to ask yourself:
How difficult is it for your new website visitors to find and purchase a trial membership?
Could a new website visitor easily find and view your class schedule?
If these processes aren’t seamless, your future clients may become
lost
leads.
What Is the Glofox Website Integration?
The Glofox
website integration
is a uniquely branded “portal” that sits within your current website. It provides members with a seamless experience as they browse your schedule, courses, appointments, memberships, packages or whatever action they wish to take.
The possibilities are endless.
Your website integration not only allows members to browse, but also to book and pay for your Services directly from your website.
How Can I Use It to Drive Revenue to My Fitness Business?
Your website can become your number one source of quality clients, if you give visitors exactly what they need to act in real time. Not to mention, when you let your members self serve, you have more time to focus on growing your business.
1. On Your Website
Make Website Browsing a Breeze
We all know how frustrating it is when you can’t find what you’re looking for, where you’d expect it to be. If your clients have to bounce from page to page to view your schedule, book a class or purchase a membership, it’s likely that they’ll get lost, angry and give up in the process.
Unlike other website integrations, Glofox gives you the option to create custom links, so you can add booking options and membership purchase options where it makes sense for your website and your business.
Schedule View & Instant Booking
So a client is scrolling through your calendar and they see a class or appointment they would like to book. Can they book there and then or must they navigate to another page to do so? When you make it easy for your members, they do it. Simple as!
Sell Memberships and Courses
No longer does a client have to call or email to purchase your services. They can do so anytime, anywhere, When you integrate Glofox with your website, you have an exciting opportunity to turn your website into the revenue generating machine you need to succeed.
2. On Your Facebook Page
You’ve worked hard to create a Facebook presence that sets you apart from the crowd and with the Glofox website integration, you can turn this social media channel into one of your top sources of bookings. It’s as easy as sharing a link to the class or course and letting your clients do the rest! All it takes is a couple of clicks.
Check out the example below from Squat Club. Their Facebook post links to a specific “Book Now” option on their website.
Book Now Button
You can make the most of the Facebook call to action option at the top of your business profile. While competitors let members watch a video or view their website, you’ll be driving revenue by ensuring your Facebook page visitors can easily sign up and book a class in one go.
Facebook Posts
We know that you’ve put a lot of effort into building a strong following on your Facebook page. Through the Glofox Website Integration, you can share a link to a specific class to fill available spaces. With competition as intense as it is, it’s no longer enough to just
tell people
about the great classes you have, you need to allow them to book
in the moment
, whilst they’re engaging with your business.
Paid Facebook Advertising
Do you have a January special coming up? A new course or workshop? Promoting your services to your local community is a great way to drive revenue, fast. Learn more about getting Facebook Ads up and running with our free guide

3. on Snapchat
That’s right, you can even drive your clients to book a class or purchase a membership from Snapchat! How do I add a link? It’s really easy:
1. Take your Snap;
2. Click the paperclip icon;
3. Enter your custom URL;
4. Send the snap or add it to your story!
All your Snap followers have to do is “swipe up” and they’ll be directed to book and pay!
4. in Your Email Marketing
Do you have a special workshop coming up that you want to let your clients know about? Or do you want to encourage clients on a trial membership to take the plunge and buy a full membership? You can do the work for them by putting the direct link directly in your Newsletter so it is easier than ever to buy! No fuss, no hassle, just simple purchases in seconds.

gym management software
? Well, you’ve come to the right place! If developing a kick ass marketing and business strategy is on your wish list, then you
need
to learn more about taking your gym into the mobile age. We’re not just talking about a mobile responsive website, that’s a given, we’re talking about
a branded mobile app
that gives your customers the ultimate member experience.
Why mobile you ask? Think about it. Your clients are glued to the devices in their hands 24/7, 365 days a year.
According to Tech Crunch
, the average time spent on apps is increasing 21% year on year – with no sign of slowing down.
Not only should you embrace this trend, but take advantage of it to make
managing bookings
and engaging members a simple task! Anyway, who wouldn’t want to take advantage of mobile to deliver rich and contextual content to any customer who has downloaded their app?!
Let’s take a look at the 5 consequences you could fall victim to if you don’t take your gym into the mobile age:
1. Would You Lose Out on a Direct Marketing Channel?
Hell yes. One of the greatest benefits of having gym management software that comes with a  branded mobile app for your gym lies in the direct marketing channel that it creates. Once a member downloads your app, they essentially carry it around with them
every single day
. You can literally create booking opportunities from the palm of your members hand.
Through the use of
push notifications
, you have the potential to boost revenue, reduce class no shows, run promotions and start building meaningful relationships with your members. All with a greater chance of achieving a direct interaction with your members.
2. Would Your Gym Be Left Behind?
Your members are already using mobile apps for tasks ranging from ordering dinner right up to booking flights. No doubt that they want to be able to do the same when it comes to booking classes at their favorite gym.

Why make your members open a browser, navigate to your website, locate your schedule and then book into a class, when they could make a booking or purchase a membership in just a few of taps through their mobile phone? From here on out, it’s vital that gyms start
investing in their
member’s experience
, or risk being left in the stone age.
3. Would Your Gym Lose Members to Competitors?
Competition is getting intense with micro gyms and boutique studios springing up on every street corner. Not to mention, your members are becoming increasingly tech savvy. This makes them more likely to opt for a gym or studio who caters to their needs. That’s right, mobile is no longer seen as a ‘nice to have’, it’s
expected
.
What’s making competition
even more
intense is that startup gyms have acknowledged this gap in the market and are turning to mobile to create a unique advantage. The hard truth? It’s a lot tougher to be the second gym app on a prospective member’s phone than the first.
4. Would You Lose Member Engagement?
Increasingly, more people are ditching the gym and opting to workout at home. Less inconveniences, zero cost — it can seem like the perfect solution. One thing’s for sure, this puts the importance of member engagement on a whole other level. Not only are you competing with rival gyms for your member’s attention, but you’re essentially competing with their home.
It’s time you utilised gym management software to create a strategy that overcomes the inconveniences associated with your member’s gym going experience. Think to yourself: how easy do I make it for members to
book and pay
for my services? Do I add value to my member’s day, in the gym and out? A mobile app is a great way to keep your members interacting with your gym. By sending motivational and inspirational messages, blog posts and class reminders you can be sure to stay top of your members’ mind.
5. Would You Let Member Loyalty Slip?
Loyal members are invaluable to your gym, however, in order to create loyalty you must first create customer satisfaction. It’s inevitable, expectations are increasing and the more members feel their needs aren’t being met, the more dissatisfied they will become.
Lucky for you, when you’re just a fingertip away from your members attention, you’ve increased power to keep satisfaction rates high and loyalty even higher. Once you begin to grow and strengthen a personal connection between your gym and your members, you could then reap the rewards of referrals from members who really are passionate about what you do.

The fitness industry is going through a significant transition, moving away from rigid and traditional contracts to providing flexibility and convenience to members across the board.
The right management software can assist in increasing revenue and member retention, creating a central hub for member and lead management and overall taking your fitness business to the next level. In this article, we will discuss what exactly
gym management software
is and the 6 essential features to look out for when choosing a management system for you.
What is Gym Management Software?
At its core, gym management software allows you to set up and track payments, manage memberships and leads, manage class bookings and scheduling and gather data and offer insights. It can become a powerful set of tools that can save time, increase member engagement and boost the business overall. Whether you’re a gym owner, personal trainer, or run a health club, gym management software can help you.
A Software Solution
In recent years, fitness centers have been popping up all over the world with the health and fitness industry worth an
estimated $3.7 trillion
. While the fitness industry is booming, it’s thought that
80% of Americans
who join a gym in January quit after five months. This makes it more crucial than every for gym owners to utilize management software to retain members, attract more clients, and create the best service possible.
Gym software solutions are designed for fitness businesses that offer memberships or classes to keep track of their gym members, schedules, employees, payments and generate reports. As a business owner, you can often find yourself wearing many hats from marketing and accounting to management and personal trainer; management software helps to condense everything you need into one place.
Gym management software is a solution, so before choosing the software that’s right for you, take a broad look at your business and assess your needs. If you’re lacking member insight and struggling with member retention, then you need a platform that’s going to provide you with the right insights. Extracting data and generating reports is an essential part of any software platform and gives you the information you need to make the best business decision.
A Time Saver
By integrating your billing process and member management under one roof, it can provide a more integrated approach to running a business. If you find yourself using one system for paying your employees, another for booking in classes and a third to store sensitive member information, then it’s time to consider new gym management software.
You no longer have to switch between systems as all operational aspects of the business can be found under one roof. Eliminate time-consuming admin tasks such as reporting, member check-ins, and collecting membership payments, giving yourself more time to focus on managing and operating your business.
A survey by
Gocardless
on a 1000 millennials found that 84% would be more likely to sign up to a gym if they weren’t tied into a long-term contract. Of the members surveyed, 60% said they would pay higher monthly fees if it meant they could end their membership at any time. With a changing landscape of member expectations, potential clients are looking for more engagement, flexibility, and convenience from their gym or fitness club
6 Essential Features to Look For When Choosing Gym Management Software
When deciding what gym software to implement, make sure that it’s solving any problem you may have and will help to catapult your business forward. If you’re upgrading your system, what is it that your current system is lacking in?
Whether you want to market your gym better or offer more to your members, consider how the following features can meet your requirements and needs. To help you choose the best gym management software, here are seven essential features to keep an eye out for.
1. Streamlined Dashboard
The dashboard is your one-stop shop for everything you need. It’s the first place you will go to when using a management solution. A dashboard should be user-friendly, streamlined and facilitate a fast-learning curve for employees. The dashboard will be at the center of operations and management. From here, you can access everything from member profiles to payment processing.
2. Membership Management
Membership management is a crucial feature of any gym management software. Bringing in new members and retaining existing ones is the bread and butter of a gym. One of the main reasons to use a management platform is to serve your members better and ensure they keep coming back to your gym and renew their membership when the time comes. Members should be able to access their membership history, book training sessions, and classes, and pay for bookings all through the gym software system.
By creating a member portal and streamlining this part of the business, employees can spend less time on specific tasks. Member check-ins at the front desk, which may have needed paperwork filled out by hand in the past can now be done through the system, making much more efficient use of employee’s time.
As well as provide members with an easy-to-use system to make their life easier, membership management means you can access several features all from your dashboard. Instead of taking bookings on the phone or replying to simple queries over email, members can find what they need through the software platform without making a call. Employees will be able to view and update member information easily.

Losing paperwork will no longer be an issue as files and contracts can be stored electronically on the system. Being able to access this information from wherever you are is vital. In today’s world, gym management software should be accessible from your mobile device or tablet while you’re on the go.
3. Bills, Invoices and Sales
Processing payments is crucial in any business; it’s how you get paid and how the company stays in operation. Payments are an essential feature when choosing the best gym management software. Automated billing and payment processing is key to a well-organized business. It’s not only an efficient way to receive payments but means you don’t have to chase payments from members.
Look for a system that can handle global payments with ease using different payment options such as direct debits, debit cards or credit cards. By creating payments options, you provide members with more flexibility, improving their overall experience. Manage payments and keep on top of cash flow with an easy-to-use but incredibly accurate system. When payments are coming up for members, use push notifications or automated email reminders as a way to communicate the upcoming payment.

4. Insights, Analysis and Real-Time Reporting
Stay in touch with your business with real-time reporting, analysis, and insights. Reports are a powerful tool that you can use to make better business decisions. The right reports will tell you which members are fully engaged and which members might be in danger of leaving. This then allows you to step in and see what changes you need to make to increase member retention.
Insightful metrics show where you need to make improvements and what you need to focus on. By using reporting, you can double down on key revenue drivers and make informed decisions. Reporting is excellent for providing insights into members as well as your financial landscape. Look at your finances at a glance in a digestible format that’s easy to understand.
Payment-related insights can give you a higher probability of collecting missed or late payments. Track exactly how your members are paying, including payment methods and billing cycles.
Track your growth against your goals and monitor a number of metrics, including:
Lead management and conversion
Total revenue
Employee costs
Membership retention and sales
Attendance rates
5. Branded Mobile App
Americans look at their phones an average of
52 times a day
. A unique branded mobile app integrated fully with your gym management software is the perfect opportunity to stay connected with your members. Create a direct sales channel, point of sale, and drive bookings through a mobile app. Your brand represents your business and keeping consistent branding across all channels is key to increasing brand awareness and building loyalty. Consistent branding
increases revenue by up to 23%
.
Allow members to book, pay for, and keep track of classes and membership plans on their mobile device. This creates another way for members to spend money while offering complete convenience. Being able to communicate with your members so easily through reminders, push notifications, and alerts are crucial to engaging users properly. In today’s modern world, where technology has a place in almost every industry, a mobile app is integral in offering the best member experience possible and driving revenue.
If you’re still undecided on whether your business needs a mobile app or not, here are
five reasons why your gym or studio definitely needs one
.
6. Social Media and Website Integration
As you know, social media is a fantastic way to connect with people. When it comes to brands,
62% of millennials
are more loyal to them if they engage with them via social messaging. Your gym management software needs to be integrated with your social media and your website to allow users to pay and book in fitness classes and keep track of their membership. Whether your member is on their phone or a computer, it should be effortless for the user across all channels.

LITTLE ROCK, AR, AND DUBLIN, IRELAND, August 2, 2022 – ABC Fitness Solutions (ABC), the leading technology and related services provider for the fitness industry, has announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Glofox, one of the fastest-growing fitness management platforms servicing the boutique gym and studio sector. The strategic combination significantly expands ABC’s global reach and amplifies its ability to serve fitness organizations of all sizes with a company that shares its values, commitment to its teams and customers, and proven track record in developing innovative solutions that allow fitness operators to thrive. The transaction is expected to close later this year.
Glofox was founded by former professional rugby player Conor O’Loughlin, and his colleagues Finn Hegarty and Anthony Kelly, and all three will continue to be leaders in the combined business. Glofox is widely recognized as an innovator in management software, helping boutique fitness brands build and grow successful businesses. Its all-in-one platform allows users to manage all aspects of their business with a streamlined, easy-to-use experience for members and staff alike.

Collectively they will support over 31 million members across more than 24,000 fitness locations with technical solutions that put the member at the center of the experience.
“We are so excited to welcome Glofox into ABC Fitness Solutions. Its range of solutions, focus on the boutique gym and studio sector, and impressive international reach are compelling and will help cement ABC’s position as a truly global solution provider within the fitness industry,” said Bill Davis, CEO of ABC Fitness Solutions. “When combined with our existing strength in North and Latin America, as well as our market-leading software solutions for the personal trainer and commercial fitness club sectors, we now have a combined offering greater than the sum of its parts and unrivalled by any company in the industry.”
The agreement follows the successful strategic acquisitions and integration of Trainerize, GymSales, and FitnessBI that helped enhance ABC’s best-in-class club management software solutions, leading to ABC IGNITE, its next generation and most advanced offering to date. From personal trainers to yoga studios, boutique gyms to commercial fitness clubs, the addition of Glofox means ABC can now serve any fitness provider of any size worldwide.
“We are thrilled to become part of ABC, a company that has been a pioneer of the fitness industry for over 40 years,” said Conor O’Loughlin, CEO & Co-Founder of Glofox. “To be able to align with a partner that shares the same purpose and values and that can provide additional resources to drive innovation and accelerated international growth is a tremendous advantage to our team and our customers. As part of ABC Fitness Solutions, Glofox has an extremely exciting future, and we look forward to taking the combined business to the next level.”

Alex Hormozi.
Among many other things, Alex Hormozi is the founder and owner of
Gym Launch
, a business that helps gym owners build massively profitable gyms. Initially, he struggled just like every other gym owner with bookings, sales, and managing a turbulent business in an ever-changing industry.
Now, after a long journey of learning and experiments, Alex has transformed one struggling gym into a fitness business empire that has helped countless businesses thrive around the world.
Today, Alex and his partner run
Acquisition.com
, a portfolio of companies that generate over $200,000,000 a year in sales.
In short, Alex has made the mistakes and done the research to create a successful business that capitalizes on the opportunities of the fitness industry.
So, how can you do the same?
Well, you’re in luck, because we sat down with Alex Hormozi and he shared the top lessons you need to boost your sales and create a successful fitness business.
If you want to learn how to convert your leads into sales, create a versatile business model, and prepare for the best (and worst), this is the interview for you.
Alex Hormozi’s 5 Key Lessons for Boosting Your Business
1. Change Your Mindset
“The primary thing, and this is what everyone who is in the fitness space has to understand, is that you’re not going to be the Beachbody of online workouts, you’re not going to be the Precision Nutrition of nutrition.
So what are the competitive advantages that a small business owner has in a local or super local marketplace?
It’s accountability, and it’s service.”
Alex Hormozi
One of the key takeaways from this conversation is that there needs to be a change in the way you think about running a fitness business.
If you’re a small-to-medium-sized business, you need to understand that you need to step away from thinking about what your competition has, and instead focus on what
you
have.
People are coming to your classes or your studio because you provide a more personalized, community-driven experience: capitalize on that.
Make sure you are creating a community feeling in every facet of your business model – from the very first welcome as they step into your business to the t-shirt they wear to celebrate being a part of your business.
Key Takeaway:
You’re a business owner, you’ve poured your heart and soul into this business, find ways to share and show that passion with your members – it’ll make all the difference.

2. They’re Paying You To Care, So Care
“People know they need to stop eating shit and move, right. They all know that. They can Google nutrition plan, they can Google free online workout – you are not going to differentiate or provide value in access in that way. What you are going to be able to provide value is getting them to do the thing that they are not doing. People pay for you to pay attention.”
Alex Hormozi
Alex makes the very solid point that people aren’t coming to you to get fit, they can do that on their own – they’re coming to you for
accountability.
They need someone to be checking in on their progress every week, making sure that they’re sticking to their routine and getting the exercise they need.
You and your business need to make sure that you are doing that job for your members. You need to show them that you care, because you
do
care. These are your customers, and your success relies on their success. Your job doesn’t end when they’ve left your gym or studio – in fact, it’s just begun. As soon as they leave your premises, they need to know that you have their back, and that you will be reaching out to them with guidance, encouragement, and advice.
Key Takeaway:
Create a clear system of encouragement and accountability in your communication plans – your customers need to know you care, and it’s on you to show that.
3. Each Member Of Staff Needs to Generate Revenue
“The remainder of your staff’s day should be on cold reachouts. That means messaging people, making posts, responding to people who comment or like, and asking them if they know anybody who would be interested. When they do that they become revenue generators, not just revenue maintainers or preservers. Now they are actively maintaining revenue for you by keeping your existing customers happy, delivering a higher level of service.”
Alex Hormozi
Each member of staff needs to have a function that ultimately drives revenue for your business.
No matter the size of your business, you’re going to have your coaches, and then your admin staff (if you’re just starting out, I assume you’re both).
Even if you or your staff are fully booked with your classes, there’s always time to send a message or an email. You need to be relentless in promoting your business online and over the phone: people can never have too much visibility on your business.
Even if it’s just spending 30 minutes a day reaching out through text, email, or social media, that’s better than nothing.
Build out an accountability structure where cold or new leads are being sought out constantly. Remember, in the fitness world, attrition is inevitable. In most fitness businesses,
attrition is 50% a year
.
That means for every two people you get in the door, you need to already be thinking about adding the next customer, because one of those is going to be gone in less than 12 months, if you’re lucky.
Key Takeaway

4. You Have to be Bad at Something Before Being Good
“There is no way of homeworking your way through it.
You can only watch trainings for so long: at a certain point you need to dive in the water. You need to step into the ring and get punched in the face – you can watch all the UFC you want but it doesn’t mean you can fight.
It just basically takes 25 attempts of sucking to kind of figure out the flow of how the script works. I can give you the words to say right now but it’s not about the words. Words are 20% of it. 80% of it is how you say the words. It’s the tonality and the frame you can control on the sale.
”
Alex Hormozi
This is probably the most important point of all – you’re not going to be good at something the first time you try it, and this is especially true for sales.
Training can only get you so far, and your leads are always going to be throwing you curveballs – the only way of learning how to manage those curveballs is by stepping up to the plate.
You and your staff need to get through this learning process, so that you can have a well-oiled, experience sales machine that brings you solid leads and a clear closing rate every single month.
As a secondary point,
every single person in your business needs to be trained in sales
. It happens all the time that someone drops in at the wrong moment and speaks to the wrong person: the worst possible thing that person can do at that moment is hand the lead a phone number and say it’s not their problem. You need to prep and drill into all your staff that sales
is their problem
and train them on every step of the closing process.
Key Takeaway:
You and your team need to get on the phone and start making mistakes – it’s the only way to learn how to become a closing machine.
5. Your First Sale is Only the Beginning of the Process
“There are three sales that should happen.
The first is going to be your service sell. This is a front-end service sell.
The second sale is going to happen 24-48 hours later where you go through a nutrition consultation.
This is the point where you then also have staff recommending supplements. You are talking $80-$200 a head in profit per person in addition within the first 24-48 hours. That alone can cover the cost of acquisition for a customer which means your front-end service revenue was 100% profit.
The third sale should happen on Day 14. At this point, you should have gained a certain amount of trust. That’s the point you can sell at the real price points that you are accustomed to selling to and get repaid $2000+ for sales.”
Alex Hormozi
This technique is how you go from just getting by to opening your second and third locations.
The opening sale is how you keep the lights on, it’s your bread and butter, but it can’t sustain you for long.
You and your staff need to have a clear and solid onboarding program that not only turns each client into a superfan and a brand advocate from all the care and attention they’ve been getting, but also a dependable and willing source of income for your business.
This final point is the end goal of all the hard work you’ve put into community building, sales outreach, and training – when all of the four previous points are running smoothly, this should be the inevitable result.
Remember, This is All Achievable
Running a fitness business is not the easiest thing in the world: but you’re not in this because it’s easy, you’re in this because you’re passionate.
Remember these five points, use them as your north star, and you will slowly start to see your revenue increase.
Alex Hormozi’s Five Steps to Success
Change your mindset
They’re paying you to care, so care
Each member of your staff needs to be a sales machine
You need to be bad at something before being good
Your first sale is only the beginning of the process

Running a fitness business can be both fulfilling and challenging. As a gym owner, you know that daily operations and administrative tasks can take up a lot of time. Fortunately, gym management software can help you streamline your operations, reduce human error, and save resources. By optimizing your gym’s systems and processes, you can create a great member experience, process payments, and ensure a safe fitness environment while generating revenue and running a profitable business.
So, what is gym management software, and what can it do for your gym? In this article, we’ll discuss the benefits of gym management software and some of the top features to consider.
What is Gym Management Software and What Can It Do?
Gym management software, also known as fitness software, is a software solution that helps businesses streamline, organize, and run their operations. It offers both an employee and a client-facing portal, enabling gym owners to better manage both their facilities and members.
Membership Management
In most fitness businesses, members are the core of your decision-making and success. Gym management software allows you to manage your members effectively by automating marketing and lead generation for maximum efficiency. You can also use it to engage members, schedule classes, and give them complete control over their membership.
Streamline Business Operations
Gym management software can also help with staff scheduling, processing member payments, club inventory management, and payroll, among other things. By streamlining your business operations, you’ll have more time for other important tasks and access valuable data to make better-informed business decisions.
Organize Administrative Tasks
Gym management software can also ease the burden of lengthy administrative tasks like signing up new members, filling out contracts, and canceling memberships. You can automate reminders for members to pay bills, saving time on admin work and reducing the number of late payments.
Why Gym Owners Need Gym Management Software
Although it can be intimidating to invest in a new system, the benefits of gym management software far outweigh the reasons not to use it. Here are three really important, tangible reasons why gym owners need gym management software:

Optimize Gym Operations
Club management software can optimize your fitness center operations by helping you and your team perform tasks more efficiently. Automating routine tasks like membership renewal, member check-in, and data entry can streamline the way you operate, giving you and your staff more time and energy to focus on other areas of the business that will impact the bottom line.
Create an Incredible Member Experience
Creating a great member experience results in happy and satisfied members, increasing member retention and reducing churn. Gym management software with a user-friendly member mobile app gives customers access to class scheduling, payments, and membership details, making the journey from booking to paying for a class intuitive without any hurdles. Members can also use a digital waiver, and avoid long conversations at the front desk.
Make Better-Informed Decisions
Gym management software gives you access to real-time metrics and analytics so that you can have deeper insights into retail sales, membership performance, and the overall state of the business. By understanding and harnessing data, you can make more impactful decisions. You can also use data-driven personalization to increase member retention and consistency, two critical factors in the member journey.
Before we wrap this post up, we want to give you two lists. The first, a full breakdown of the benefits you should expect from implementing great gym management software. The second, a list of the top features you should ensure any platform you look at handles well.

Make this the year you trade in outdated processes for gym booking software—
an engine driving your business into the future.
Gym class booking software can make scheduling for
yoga studios
smoother than your most popular flow class
. For franchises, it can help control the chaos of running a multi-location business. And for
personal training studios
, it can help transform your one-on-one vibe into a
craveable community.
In short, it’s an
all-in-one solution
designed to make running your fitness studio so much easier.
Below, we’ll cover how gym booking software works, what your members can and should expect from it, and how to choose the best option for your studio this year.
Read on to learn how gym booking software can
give you back your time
and
help you grow every aspect of your fitness business
.
How Gym Scheduling Software Streamlines Operations and Saves Time
Your studio’s digital fingerprint is just as impactful for your business as that Saturday morning spin class with a cult following.
To stay ahead of the curve,
your fitness studio needs technology that
simplifies bookings, streamlines payments,
and
builds a community around your brand.
Enter
ABC Glofox:
Smart, integrated booking software for gyms and fitness businesses who want to get ahead
. Don’t let waitlists, billing reminders, and membership renewals bog you down—find efficiency you didn’t even know existed with our gym class booking software.
Let’s look at 3 key ways our software can help:
It acts as a personal assistant
The best gym booking software
eliminates repetitive tasks that eat into your precious time each week
. Are you still processing memberships by hand? Sending individual billing reminders? Manually updating class waitlists?
If so, there’s a better way
!
Imagine walking into your studio in the morning and the waitlist for that popular 7 AM Pilates class has already been dealt with. Or not having to lift a finger for billing reminders and membership renewals.
The right booking software for gyms runs these processes in the background, giving you and your team more time to
focus on the good stuff.
It eliminates manual busywork
The old-fashioned way for managing class bookings, cancellations, and rescheduling is
time-consuming
at best. At worst, it’s
error-prone
and can
negatively impact the
member experience
.
Say “no more” to endless phone calls and long email threads. With gym class booking software, your members can take things into their own hands and
book, cancel, or change appointments anytime, anywhere.

10 Barriers Slowing Your Fitness Business Growth
What Your Members Expect From a Class Booking Experience
Your members use their smartphones for
everything
these days—
from ordering their morning coffee to finding dinner ideas.
Booking software for gyms and studios like yours needs to meet their expectations (and deliver the goods!) right from the get-go.
Here are 2 of the boxes your studio booking platform needs to check:
A mobile-friendly UX
Did you know that
nearly 90% of mobile internet usage is spent within apps, with users spending about
4 hours and 38 minutes daily
on mobile apps?
This means that, above all,
your members want
convenience
. They want to book classes from their phones and manage their membership without any fuss.
Therefore, the best gym booking software includes a
companion mobile app
that allows members to do all this and more.
In turn, your business becomes part of your members’ daily flow as they see
who’s teaching the noon yoga class or book a spin class from the grocery store
. You’ll also stay top-of-mind with your members 24/7 through
personalized messaging
via social media updates, emails, and text.
Instant confirmations and reminders
When members receive a confirmation that they’re registered for a class,
they’re more likely to show up for it
. Think of it like a text from your friend saying, “Still on for coffee at 10?”
Instant email and text notifications
are now standard in online fitness booking systems.
Don’t go quiet
: tell your members that they matter, and that you’re excited to welcome them!

Awareness & Lead Generation: Top 4 Gym Lead Generation Tactics in 2025
Today, when someone walks into your gym, they’re usually not there to
discover
.
Most probably, they’ve already compared your facility online, read reviews, watched videos, and maybe even interacted with your brand on social media. Most of the decision-making happens before they ever step through the door.
That’s the reality of a
digital-first fitness buyer
in 2025. People shortlist gyms from their smartphones, scrolling through
Google results
, checking Instagram, or even asking AI chat tools for recommendations on the “best fitness studio near me.”
If you’re not showing up in those moments, you’re invisible to a huge share of potential members.

#2: Create Content That Answers FAQs
FAQ sections have become increasingly important in the last two years because that’s also how Gen AI tools like ChatGPT, now used by billions, process and deliver information. People don’t scroll for long anymore; they want instant, clear answers to their questions.
Start by collecting recurring questions:
Can I freeze my membership?
Is there parking nearby?
Next, answer each across different channels:
Story highlights:
Quick answers about memberships, classes, or trials
Short-form social media posts (videos, carousels):
“3 Things to Know Before Joining a Gym in [City]”
Long form (Blogs, longer videos):
“How to Choose the Right Fitness Studio for You”
Use these as entry points to your site or app, linking directly to trial sign-ups or consultations inside
your Glofox app
.

#3: Run Virtual Events or Webinars
Hybrid membership sales have increased from clubs to small studios. That’s because people want to be able to attend face-to-face classes as well as have options to train from the comfort of their home, or wherever they are.
With
hybrid engagement
offerings, you can host free digital sessions that give prospects a taste of your coaching style:
A 30-minute “Ask a Trainer” Q&A
A free mobility or recovery class on Instagram Live
A goal-setting or nutrition webinar streamed to your members’ app
These sessions are a great, unique selling point that will position your studio as helpful and human, two key factors in early trust.
#4: Leverage Social Proof & UGC
Nothing sells memberships like seeing real people win. Let your members do the talking for you with
UGC
; people trust others more than any promotional line you could write.
Encourage members to tag your studio, share class check-ins, or film short before-and-after clips.
Repost those stories everywhere: your website, paid ads, and app feed. When prospects see real progress and energy from real members, it builds credibility faster than any sales pitch.
You can also use this content in your sales process. Add member success clips to your follow-up emails, trial sequences, or pricing page. When someone’s hesitating, seeing others achieve what they want to achieve often tips the scales.
Lead Nurturing & Engagement: Turn Interest into Intent
If you’re looking to reduce lead drop-off as a fitness studio, this is the stage where you should pay extra attention. Leads drop off between “I’m curious” and “I’m in.” Close that gap with timely, segmented touchpoints that feel personal and move people to a clear next step.
#5: Segmented Email & Push Notification Campaigns
The fastest way to increase your fitness membership
conversion rate
in 2025 is through smarter communication. Not more, just smarter.

Add small calls to action, such as “Tap to confirm your spot” or social proof (“70 members joined this month”). These light touches can quickly increase fitness membership conversion rate without extra admin.
Metrics to watch:
open rate, click-to-book rate, trial booked rate, time-to-first-visit.
#6: Offer Free Trials, Guest Passes, or Mini-Workouts
Structured trials remain one of the most effective ways to convert fitness leads into members. Start by creating a clear, time-bound offer within your ABC Glofox dashboard, such as a single class or a 3-day access pass.
Send digital passes or QR codes right to a prospect’s phone and let them book a slot instantly. Once they attend, the follow-up sequence should trigger automatically:
6 hours later:
A quick check-in (“How was your first class? Anything surprise you?”)
24 hours later:
A friendly invitation (“We’d love to help you build momentum. Join this week to lock in your trial rate.”)
72 hours later:
A gentle final nudge (“Your trial window closes soon! Want me to save you a spot?”)
Mention their coach or class by name in the follow-up. “Coach X said you crushed that workout, ready for round two?” feels real, not automated.
Metrics to watch:
trial-to-join conversion, no-show rate, and time-to-join.
#7: Use Retargeting Ads for People Who Visited “Pricing” Page
If someone hits your pricing page, they’re already interested, so all they need is a little nudge. Retargeting helps you
reduce lead drop-off
by re-engaging warm prospects right where they scroll most.
You can create a custom audience for these visitors (excluding current members) and run 2–3 short ads over the course of a week. Keep it helpful, not pushy:
“Still thinking about it? Here’s what new members are saying.”
“Ready to start? Your first class is one tap away.”
Sync your
ABC Glofox CRM
to retarget by
lead status
, like “Trial Complete” or “No-Show,” so you’re only spending on people who are close to joining.
Metrics to watch:
CTR, trial bookings, and cost per conversion.
#8: Create Lead Magnets
When you deliver value upfront, you make it easier for prospects to self-select and for you to personalize your follow-up later.
Here’s what’s working right now:
Quizzes or assessments
: focused on a person’s specific goals or class preferences. Once they complete it, you can tag them in ABC Glofox (Beginner Strength, Mobility, HIIT) to personalize follow-ups.
Personalized plans
: simple, actionable guides that outline what they should start doing now and over the next few weeks to reach their goals.
You can either boost your quiz or plan as a Meta ad with a short lead form, or share it organically on social media.

Conversion & Sales Process
This third stage is what was previously considered the
traditional
sales phase. But in 2025, sales are not an isolated event at the end of the funnel. It’s part of the entire member journey, from the first ad someone sees to the moment they sign up and beyond.
Today,
sales and marketing
work hand-in-hand across every touchpoint. The goal is no longer to “close” someone, but to guide them through a smooth, consistent process that feels personal and aligned with their goals.
But that doesn’t mean you can skip the direct sales conversations!
#9: Improve the Sales Conversation: Scripts, Training, and Listening
A strong
sales conversation
starts with clarity. Everyone on your team should know exactly what your unique selling propositions are, what sets your gym apart from competitors, and why your members stay.
That means documenting your process:
Common questions and suggested responses
Core selling points (community, hybrid options, personalized coaching)
Quick-reference objection replies
Empathy-based closers (“Let’s find a schedule that fits your week”)
Then, you can use ABC Glofox Notes to share pointers with your staff and keep track of each prospect’s latest conversations, preferences, and progress.

#10: Transparent Pricing and Membership Options
Transparency builds trust, and your team should know how to explain value before price.
Lay out your tiered and hybrid membership options clearly:
Basic:
Gym access + class bookings
Hybrid:
In-person + digital programs + progress tracking
Premium:
All access + PT sessions + nutrition coaching
Use
ABC Glofox
to display these plans within your
branded app
, allowing prospects to compare, select, and upgrade with ease. Keeping pricing visible and flexible also helps when you run short-term promos or limited offers.
Ensure your sales scripts include personalized recommendations for each lead and member on what works best for each situation, for example: “Most members start with Hybrid, it gives you in-person structure and app support between sessions.”
#11: Streamline the Sign-Up Process
Getting someone to say “yes” is only half the job; if your sign-up process is clunky, you risk losing momentum immediately. A fast, slick digital sign-up that seamlessly transitions into a solid onboarding experience is what keeps people engaged.
In fact, a good
onboarding process
can lead to
87% of new gym members remaining active six months later
.
So: use
ABC Glofox
to handle everything from membership selection to digital contracts, payments, and onboarding steps, in one seamless path. Post-signup, trigger welcome messages, new member check-ins, and how-to guides so people don’t feel dropped into the deep end.
#12: Overcome Objections with Empathy & Data
In the fitness industry, the objections are essentially the same: cost, time, lack of confidence, or fear of failure.
The goal isn’t to push harder; it’s to
listen, validate, and guide
.
Here’s how to handle the most common ones:
“It’s too expensive.”
Response: “I totally get it, investing in your health is a big decision. Most of our members actually save more over time compared to drop-in sessions, and our hybrid tiers or payment plans make it flexible.”
“I don’t have time.”
Response: “Completely fair. That’s why we built short 30-minute classes, early and late options, and at-home workouts in the app. You don’t have to overhaul your week, just fit movement where it works.”
“I don’t know where to start.”
Response: “That’s really common. You’ll receive a guided introductory session, and our trainers will demonstrate how everything works. We also have beginner programs right in the app to make it feel easier.”
“I’ve tried before and it didn’t last.”
Response: “You’re not alone there. The difference this time is structure; we track every session in the app, check in weekly, and adjust as you go. You’ll always know what to do next.”
“I need to think about it/talk to someone.”
Response: “Totally fine. What questions can I answer for you right now? I can also hold your preferred class time for a day or two while you decide.”
Keep these responses in a simple internal script or quick-reference document for your team, so everyone uses the same empathetic tone and clear reasoning.
Retention & Upsell
#13: Upselling Add-Ons: Personal Training, Nutrition Coaching, Hybrid Classes
Upselling is a sales strategy that increases the value of an existing customer by encouraging them to purchase higher-tier or complementary services.
In the fitness business, it’s how you
increase average revenue per member (ARPM)
and
boost lifetime value (LTV)
, without spending more to acquire new clients.
In practice, it means offering add-ons that expand a member’s experience and commitment:
Personal Training:
a member on a base plan adds one weekly PT session.
Nutrition Coaching:
a client pairs meal planning or habit tracking with training.
Hybrid Memberships:
in-person clients add app-based workouts or livestream access.
Small Group Programs:
a class regular joins a premium accountability or transformation group.
Merch
:
apparel, supplements, or recovery gear purchased through your app
You can simply use
ABC Glofox
data to identify moments that trigger interest. For example, if the member consistently attends, you can offer PT or nutrition support.

#14: Member Loyalty & Referral Programs
Most gyms offer loyalty or referral programs, but few actually generate revenue from them. The problem is that they’re usually built on random discounts or giveaways instead of a well-thought-out strategy.
A good program should have one goal:
extend member lifetime value (LTV)
while
reducing acquisition costs (CAC)
.
Think of it in two layers:
#1: Loyalty:
Reward members for the behaviors that improve retention, attendance, renewals, milestones, and engagement.
Award points for every check-in, streak, or referral.
Offer upgrades, not freebies, like “Reach 50 sessions, unlock a 1:1 goal-setting consult” instead of a free T-shirt.
#2:
Referrals
:
Provide them with simple, shareable referral links or QR codes directly within your Glofox app.
Incentivize both sides: “Refer a friend and each gets a free class or $25 off your next month.”
Track who brings in the most referrals and recognize them publicly; social recognition builds status, which drives more referrals than financial incentives.

How to Market a Gym Referral Program
#15: Use App Engagement & Tags to Identify Prospects or At-Risk Members
Your member data reveals where revenue is leaking and where new opportunities lie. With
ABC Glofox Tags
and
engagement reports
, you can identify trends and take action before they impact your bottom line.
Here’s how to use it strategically:
At-risk members:
Trigger a reactivation message or even a call for anyone who has missed two weeks, has canceled bookings, or hasn’t opened the app.
High-engagement members:
Perfect candidates for upsells, ambassador programs, or referral requests.
Expired trials or frozen accounts:
Send targeted rejoin offers or short-term promos to reactivate.
Of course, don’t rely solely on automation. Combine app data with personal follow-ups, the mix of digital tracking and human touch is what actually drives renewals and reactivations.

4 Sales Principles to Convert Fitness Leads to Members
Nail the First Impression (Online + Offline):
You’ve got less than seven seconds to make an impression, some
studies
say as little as a tenth of a second. And that moment doesn’t just happen at the front desk anymore. It happens when someone lands on your website, checks your Google reviews, or opens your social media. Make sure what they see matches the experience they’ll get.
Ask the Right Questions Early:
Don’t jump straight into selling. Ask why they reached out, what their goals are, and what’s stopped them before. Those answers are gold; they tell you exactly how to position your offer. The sooner you understand intent, the easier it is to personalize your offer and guide them toward the right membership.
Follow a Clear Framework:
Scripts aren’t cheesy, they’re structured. Have versions for DMs, calls, tours, and cancellations, so your whole team is speaking the same language. Store notes and updates in
ABC Glofox
so no conversation gets lost in translation.
Overcome Common Objections:
Everyone hesitates for the same reasons: price, time, fear, or the familiar refrain, “I’ve tried this before.” The key is to recognize those patterns and train for them, rather than winging it. If you want to sharpen that skill,
The Sales Gravy Podcast
by Jeb Blount (https://salesgravy.com/podcasts/) is worth a listen—simple, actionable advice that actually applies to fitness sales.

Big international franchises like F45, Orangetheory and Soulcycle are examples of this. They have unique slogans, wording, tone, color schemes and culture that resonates strongly with your members.
In our popular blog on branding a fitness business, we talk about
The Ultimate 5 Step Fitness Studio Branding Framework.
This framework gives you a process that can help you develop your own brand. One step in the process is  “Define What Make You Different” which is all to do with brand identity.  What this means is that you need to develop a unique set of values that makes your brand different from everyone else.
So in this article, we will take a look at what branding is, why it matters and how you can develop a brand identity for yourself.

10 Steps to Developing Your Brand Identity
What Is Branding and Why Does It Matter?
What Is Branding?
Although “branding” comes from the ancient practice of
branding cattle with your logo
to signify ownership, the term has taken on a whole new meaning in modern marketing.
Your brand is not just your logo design, color scheme, visual elements, venue, web design, product, values, or any other component of your business. It’s all of those things — and more.
In short, your
brand is the sum total of all your efforts
as a business.
When done correctly, your brand will be the sum that is greater than all the individual parts.
Why Does Branding Matter?
That’s all well and good, you might think, but what’s wrong with just setting up a decent fitness studio and running it well? Why go the extra mile to create a brand?
Because
branding will pay off
— both in the short run and over time.
Yes, it may seem like a lot of extra work of which you may don’t see the immediate benefit. But since you’ll have to do most of the things it takes to create a brand anyway, all you need to do is put all the pieces together.
Here are some of the main
benefits you’ll enjoy
when you have a solid brand in place:
Direction
– Your brand tells you what to do next, how to market yourself, and how to stay true to your core values.
Competition
– A good brand will set you apart from your competition so it’s easy to tell you apart in a crowded market like the fitness world.
Recognition
– People will instantly recognize your brand, even if they don’t immediately know it’s your business, based on the feelings you instill in them.
Consistency
– Branding brings order to chaos and enables you to stay consistent across platforms, markets, and even time.
Trust
– That brand consistency will build trust with your target market so they know what to expect every time they interact with your business.
Loyalty
– Finally, and most importantly, the trust you build with customers will turn into powerful brand loyalty, which is incredibly valuable.
As you can see, a brand is real estate. Need some actual proof? Let’s look at what other fitness studios have done in terms of branding.
Examples of Great Fitness Branding to Inspire Your Own Brand
You know what branding is and why it’s important. Now it’s time to look at some real-life examples of how it works in action.
We’ve rounded up some of the most well-known fitness brands that have mastered the art of branding both online and offline.
See if you can spot the similarities and identify the red thread that runs through their branding strategies.
1. Equinox
Equinox is one of the most well-known gym chains in the US, and there’s a good reason for that. Their branding is amazing, and the best part is that they built it up from almost nothing within one year. From 2012 to 2013, they more than doubled their online following through rebranding.
How did they do that? First of all, they came up with a great slogan: “It’s not fitness … it’s life.” But they also began to publish lifestyle content to go with that slogan and ran engaging competitions on social media.
Finally, they also tapped into the concept of community by donating to cancer research.
2. Crunch Gym
Crunch Gym is another fitness franchise that has had great success with their online branding. They now count over 250 branches across the world — and they’re still counting.
Crunch Gym peppers their social media feeds with short videos that give their target audience quick tips on how to expand their fitness routine. They’ve also capitalized on Foursquare as a marketing tool, and regularly offer their members special perks. These include free bottles of water and guest passes.
Finally, they’ve also run charity fundraising campaigns similar to Equinox above.
3. Nike
Nike is one of those brands that almost need no introduction. But it’s exactly for that reason we need to give them a mention here. When you see the “Swoosh” logo, you immediately know what it’s all about: “Just Do It.”
They’re not afraid to partner with well-known celebrities who then wear their clothes in marketing campaigns. But they also offer insightful background stories from athletes to inspire their audience.
The best part? Most of the time, they only have to make a minimal reference to their own brand… you already know it’s Nike.
4. Under Armour
Under Armour is so much more than just a sportswear brand. Sure, their main bread and butter is state-of-the-art fitness clothing that will keep you warm or cool (depending on the sport) all the while you stay comfortable. But their brand focus is on “fan activation.”
They want you to actually go out and use their products to get in shape. Perhaps the key to their successful brand is that they activate their fans in more than one way. Their Ultimate Intern program invited fans to pitch themselves to the brand in order to win an internship as their next social media specialist.
5. Spartan
Spartan is built around a massive obstacle course. The biggest one in the world, in fact. But this great brand offers more than impressive structures.
They sell wellness programs, nutrition products, and athletic wear. When it comes to the races on their obstacle course, they’ve heavily utilized live streaming.

10 Steps to Developing Your Brand Identity
Okay, so we’ve covered what branding is and how some of the biggest fitness companies have created their massive brands. Now the time has come to develop your own brand strategy.
1. Think About Yourself and Your Fitness Studio
Your brand personality starts with you. Hopefully, you’ve chosen to be in the fitness industry because you like sports and exercise.
So formulate what you love, why you love it, and what you’d like to contribute. That will form the basis of your fitness studio brand.
As
Simon Sinek says
in his world-famous book and speech, “Start With Why.”
2. Research Competition Fitness Studios and Brands
Once you know why you’re in the game and what you want to change, it’s time to look at the competition.
What are they doing right, and what are they doing wrong? How can you set yourself apart from them and their brand? Why should people choose your fitness studio over theirs?
Conduct some in-depth
market research
.
3. Understand Your Ideal Customer and Their Desires
Now that you’ve looked at the competition, maybe you’ve discovered that you don’t even fight for the same audience. Maybe the people you want to attract are completely different.
But who are they, exactly? And, more importantly,
what do they want
? When they look at the market for fitness studios, what’s missing from the picture?
4. Write A Mission Statement and Find Your Voice
Now that you know who you want to target and how to reach them, it’s time to
formulate a mission statement
for your fitness brand.
What are your core values and how will they be reflected in the way you conduct your business? Do you want to push your clients to the max and enhance their athletic performance? Or do you want to create a sense of community and team spirit?
5. Choose An Appropriate Name (and Visual Identity)
Have you written a mission statement? Developed a brand voice? Good. Now it’s time to
come up with a name
that reflects that and some visuals to go with it.
Think about the examples we covered earlier. Nike is a reference to the Greek goddess of victory. Spartan is named after the fierce warriors of Sparta.
Choose a name and visuals that embody your brand values.
6. Maintain Consistent Brand Guidelines
Consistency is key to many things in life, especially exercise. It’s better to do ten pushups every day of the week than to do thirty pushups one day and then have no energy to do them the next.
Same with brand consistency.
It’s better to have
simple but consistent branding
than to focus all your efforts on one area and neglect the rest.
7. Create Helpful Content and Share Inspirational Stories
You probably noticed a pattern with the examples we covered earlier. They all shared helpful content with their audience to improve their fitness routine. They also shared
inspirational stories
from world-class athletes or from their own fanbase.
The motivational and aspirational aspects of your brand will help create a sense of community and commitment.
8. Run Marketing Campaigns That Engage your Audience
It’s not enough to tell people to “get out there and get active.” You need to engage them wherever they are, and that includes online platforms such as social media.
As you saw, the examples we used all ran online competitions and participated in charity fundraisers. Identify some
ways you can engage your audience
both online and offline.
9. Analyze Your Marketing Data and Learn From It
Once you’ve engaged your audience, you’ll be left with some data. That could be in the form of email campaigns you’ve run or social media content you’ve posted.
It’s important that you take your time to
analyze it and learn from it
. What went right? What went wrong? How can you improve your next interaction with new customers?
10. Ask Your Customers for Feedback and Implement It
Data can give you a lot of insights but at the end of the day, it’s just a bunch of numbers. And numbers only tell part of the story. The rest of the story comes in the form of real
spoken or written feedback
from your audience.
What do they think about your brand? What does it make them feel? What would make them more invested in your fitness studio? How can you take it to the next level?
In Summary
So now you know what branding is, why it’s so important, how other companies have done it, and how you can develop your brand identity.
Here are some key takeaways:
Your brand is the sum total of all your business efforts.
Base your brand on your own personal values as a business owner.
Watch what the greats (and your competitors) are doing.
Create an experience rather than sell a product to potential customers.

How Small Gyms Can Successfully Launch a Branded App
Getting ROI From Your Branded App
Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them
Key Takeaways
Apps matter because that’s where people spend their time, make purchases, and can be reached. Last year alone,
people spent
4.2 trillion hours
inside mobile apps
.
Your members can now experience their entire fitness journey from the convenience of their phones. They can browse and book classes, stream workouts if they’re stuck inside or are traveling, and even access your studio with a phone swipe, or join challenges and track leaderboards.
All this is
table stakes
. Without it, you risk losing members to digital-first competitors who already meet those expectations.
The good news is that you don’t need to hire a developer to create a branded app just for you. With a gym management platform like
ABC Glofox
, you can quickly launch your
branded app
and provide members with the seamless digital experience they expect.
What Makes a Gym App Truly “Branded” vs. Generic
We’ve all heard of the big-name apps: MyFitnessPal, Strava, Peloton. They’re polished, popular, and valuable, but they’re
not built for your members
. They don’t carry your brand, reflect your community, or align directly with the way your gym or studio operates.
A
branded
fitness app
changes that. It’s designed to feel like an extension of your studio, not a third-party tool. That means:
Customization
: Your logo, your colors, your brand identity front and center every time members open the app
Integrated experience
: Everything members need in one place, from class schedules, bookings, payments, content, and messaging
Right-fit solutions
: From
white-label apps
(your branding on proven software) to off-the-shelf or embedded solutions, you can choose the level that fits your business
And the payoff goes beyond looks. A branded app provides
direct, free reach via push notifications
, and reports show that contextual pushes earn significantly
higher open rates
than generic ones (
14.4% vs. 4.19%
).
ABC Glofox
has made it simple, even for a single-location gym, to deliver this seamless, digital-first experience members expect.

How to Make the Most of Your Fitness Class Booking App in 2025
Top 7 Benefits of a Branded App for Small Gyms and Fitness Studios
Retention & Engagement
72% of fitness app users
say they work out more consistently when they track their progress digitally. An app does that through simplified check-ins, push reminders, and on-demand content that will keep members active between visits.
Upselling & Monetization
Smartphones accounted for
54.5% of U.S. holiday online sales
in 2024
, and
fitness apps
themselves generated
$3.98 billion in revenue
. That means there is demand, and you can offer more to your members via in-app add-ons, premium upgrades, and mini-programs from nutrition to habit coaching.
Member Experience/Convenience
Your members can sync your class schedule with their calendar and get notifications to remind them, which means less friction at the front desk. A branded app makes everyday tasks, like booking, paying, or syncing schedules to a calendar, seamless.
Differentiation/Marketing
The
fitness market
is crowded;
77M Americans (25%) belonged to a gym in 2024
, and
73% of Gen Z
are active facility users
. With so many options, your brand has to stay front and center. A branded app puts your logo and colors on members’ home screens, making your gym the default touchpoint instead of a generic third-party tool. White-label solutions give you that advantage without the cost of custom development.
Data & Insights
Tracking bookings, content engagement, and drop-off patterns helps you intervene before churn happens. Reports show that
loyalty programs
tied to apps increase revenue by
15–25%
, and redeemers spend
3.1 times more
. You can also take advantage of this and inform your future strategy.
Community Building
The best gyms aren’t just places to work out, they’re communities. A branded app extends that feeling digitally, with groups, challenges, and leaderboards.
High push opt-in rates
for health and fitness apps (
43.2% Android / 33.5% iOS
) make it easy to keep members participating and connected.
Cost & Efficiency Gains
Finally, a branded app reduces admin overhead. Automated reminders replace follow-up calls, mobile check-ins cut front-desk congestion, and in-app payments streamline billing. Time wasted on logistics is reinvested in building relationships with your members.
6 Must-Have Features Modern App Users Expect
By 2025, members expect an app that works like the best digital products on their phones. For small gyms, that means making sure your
branded app
delivers:
#1: Seamless
booking
and class management
Members expect to book, reschedule, and pay in seconds, without having to wait at the front desk. Native payments, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, make checkout instant, and passwordless sign-in with passkeys or biometrics eliminates the hassle of remembering yet another password.
#2: On-demand video and hybrid integration
Members expect to train at any time, whether at home, on the road, or in the studio. Live Activities, widgets, and wearables, such as the Apple Watch, extend that experience with real-time updates and glanceable progress.
#3: Habit coaching and layered content

The most successful fitness journeys go beyond workouts. Apps that provide habit reminders, track streaks, or layer in nutrition and wellness content help members build routines that stick, and keep them coming back to your gym as the hub for their progress.
#4: Personalized push notifications
Push isn’t just for reminders anymore.
AI-powered personalization
tailors content and timing, while granular notification controls let members choose what’s relevant. For example, you can add an automatic reminder to book their usual Tuesday spin class or encouragement when a streak is about to break.
#5: Offline and low-connection usability
Members expect workouts and schedules to load even when Wi-Fi doesn’t. Fast,
stable performance
is now a table-stakes requirement.
Over half of users
will abandon an app that’s too slow, and apps that suffer instability see sharp drops in engagement and loyalty.
#6: Analytics dashboards for owners
Finally, a modern app isn’t just for members, it’s a business tool for owners too.
Analytics
show you what’s working (popular classes, engaged content) and what’s at risk (drop-off points, churn signals), so you can make decisions based on data.

How Small Gyms Can Implement a Branded App Launch Successfully
A branded app doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Small gyms can roll it out in stages, starting lean, then layering on more features as adoption grows.
Start with core features:
Focus on the essentials first: booking, payments, and check-ins. These are the features members will use daily and will drive the fastest adoption.
Train staff and launch with intent:
Your team should be the first to use and promote the app. A coordinated
launch campaign
, including emails, in-studio signage, and social posts, ensures members know the app is ready and how to use it.
Incentivize downloads and referrals:
Offer small rewards for early adopters or tie app usage to referral programs. Even simple perks (like a free smoothie or
discounted class
) can drive momentum.
Build habits around the app:
Encourage members to check the app daily, whether it’s to log into a class, view a leaderboard, or claim an in-app offer.
Push notifications
also help reinforce the habit.
Monitor, measure, and iterate:
Check analytics regularly: adoption rate, daily active users, and feedback. Use these insights to determine when to add more features, such as on-demand content or habit coaching.

Get that ROI From Your Branded App: What to Track & Expect
One of the biggest challenges with fitness apps is high
early churn rates
. Members download, try it once or twice, and then delete it. More than
half
of apps
are uninstalled within 30 days
if they don’t deliver consistent value. For small gyms, that means you can’t just measure downloads; you need to measure usage.
Here are the key ROI metrics that matter:
Adoption rate
: How many members download and log in compared to your total membership base.
Active users
: Daily or monthly active users (DAU/MAU) indicate whether the app has become an integral part of members’ routines. Churn risk increases if members drop below a certain weekly usage level.
Retention lift
: Compare membership retention between active app users and non-users.
Upsell revenue
: Track purchases made through the app, class packs, premium content, and nutrition add-ons.
Fitness apps
generated nearly
$4 billion in 2024
, proving that consumers are willing to transact in-app.
Admin reduction
: Measure how much staff time is saved, fewer phone calls for scheduling, fewer desk transactions, and automated reminders instead of manual follow-ups.
How to fight uninstall churn:
Build habits quickly
: Push reminders, streaks, and app-exclusive offers help members form the habit of opening your app in the first 2–3 weeks
Keep the value visible:
Tie everything from booking to community challenges into the app so it feels indispensable
Update regularly
: Even minor improvements or new content drops signal that the app is alive and worth keeping

11 Ways Gym Apps Have Transformed The Fitness Industry
4 Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them
#1 Cost & budget constraints
Many gyms assume an app is out of reach, but the key is to start lean with just one or a few core features, such as booking and check-ins, before layering on additional extras.
Among three options: an expensive developer, a “vibe coding” app that won’t work, and a white-label, branded app backed by
gym management software
, the latter is more feasible and helps with cost management as well.
#2 Member resistance or download friction
You can increase the adaptation rate and decrease churn by making your app the default touchpoint: use QR codes at the desk, links in emails or SMS, and deep links that take users straight to booking.
Combine this with frictionless authentication methods like passkeys or biometric login, and then provide a quick first win, such as automatically assigning a class to book or a perk to claim. Incentivize that first action with a small reward and keep them coming back with streaks or badges.
#3 Technical support, updates, and maintenance
It can feel daunting if you’ve never managed software before. The solution is to run it like a system, not an experiment.
Add in-app help resources, such as FAQs or chat, and train your front desk staff to handle tier-1 issues before escalating them. Another benefit of opting for a white-label app is that you have dedicated support staff available to fix bugs or test new features.
#4 Ensuring connection across platforms
Your app must sync with your website, class booking system, and payments to avoid duplicate work or member confusion. An integrated solution keeps everything connected, from class calendars to payments and messaging.

Why Every Studio Needs a Gym Mobile App in 2025
Takeaways
A branded app has become the starting point for how members connect with your gym and the hook that keeps them engaged. Mobile notifications are harder to ignore, with
fitness apps
enjoying some of the
highest opt-in rates
of any category, providing you with direct, free reach long after the initial download.
The smartest path for small gyms is a white-label solution: your logo, your colors, your brand, minus the cost of custom development. It addresses the common challenges of support, updates, and integration, as it comes packaged with a comprehensive gym management platform. That means less friction, more member loyalty, and more growth.

The jump from running a single studio to managing several locations brings the promise of new revenue opportunities and an expanded market presence. But it also creates operational challenges that can hurt your business if you’re not prepared.
The bottom line:
Successful business expansion requires more than just opening new doors. You need strategic planning, scalable systems, and the right technology to maintain service quality while you grow efficiently.
This guide explores proven strategies that multi-location fitness operators use to expand—without losing the community feel and operational excellence that made their first location successful.

The Fitness Studio Expansion Cheat Sheet
TL;DR:
Scaling from one fitness location to multiple sites changes everything about how you operate. But with watertight processes, the right technology, and a strong financial foundation in place before you expand, you can grow without losing the community feel you’ve become known for.

s – Business Expansion for Gyms and Fitness Studios
Why Expansion at Scale Is Different
Business expansion
refers to the
strategic growth of a company through various methods
such as opening new locations, entering new markets, or diversifying service offerings. But scaling from 1-2 locations to 5-10+ fundamentally changes everything about how you operate.
The critical shift in operations
When you operate a single gym location, you can personally oversee member experiences, staff performance, and daily operations. This hands-on approach becomes impossible as you expand.
Consider these key challenges:
Maintaining the same member experience
across multiple locations requires SOPs, training protocols, and quality control systems that simply weren’t necessary before.
Instead of managing one team, you’re now
coordinating across multiple locations
, each with their own staff dynamics, local market conditions, and operational challenges.
Without proper systems,
tracking performance across locations
becomes a nightmare of spreadsheets and fragmented data, which makes it difficult to identify which locations are thriving and which need support.
One poorly managed location can
damage your entire brand’s reputation
in ways that affect all your sites.
Take
Special Strong
, an adaptive fitness franchise that serves individuals with special needs. Starting from just one location in 2016, they’ve since expanded to over 10 locations across 4 states.
When they decided to scale beyond their original location, they realized their manual processes wouldn’t scale. ABC Glofox helped streamline their operations, which allowed the team to enhance efficiency and improve customer service across all franchises.
“ABC Glofox offered the automation and customer support we needed to scale effectively,” shares founder Daniel Stein.
What may lead to expansion in the business cycle
Several factors typically drive fitness businesses to pursue business expansion:
→ The
market is saturated
at the current location, which has created consumer demand for more sites
→  They have a
proven business model
(consistent profitability and strong member retention)
→  They’ve built
strong brand recognition
in their local community
→  They’ve learned how to
confidently manage operations
through the success of their first location
→  They have
access to capital
through operating profit, investors, or financing
Smart operators recognize these signals and use them as a checklist, not rushing to expand until multiple indicators align.

Fitness Studio Business Strategy – Grow, Scale & Succeed
Building a Scalable Foundation Before Expansion
The most successful multi-location operators
invest heavily in systems and processes
before opening their second location. This upfront investment pays
dividends
as they continue to scale.
Consideration #1: Standardize Business Processes Early
Standard Operating Procedures
(SOPs)
provide replicable, properly documented instructions that anyone in your business can follow. Put differently, they’re the operating manual for your business. For gyms and studios, you’ll want to focus on critical areas like:
Member onboarding
Create a step-by-step process for
welcoming new members
—from the initial consultation through their first month.
This should include standardized welcome packages and
communication touchpoints
, consistent methods for goal-setting and progress tracking, as well as uniform presentations for pricing and membership options.

How to Simplify Member Onboarding With ABC Glofox
Staff training and certification
You’ll need to develop comprehensive training programs to ensure every team member delivers the same quality experience regardless of location.
Some ideas for modules to include:
Your brand values and
customer service standards
Class instruction techniques and safety protocols
Sales processes and
member retention strategies
Daily operations
Document everything from opening/closing procedures to equipment maintenance schedules. For instance, having detailed operating manuals—either print or digital—helps your team deliver a consistent member experience across locations.
Consideration #2: Leverage Technology from Day One
Without integrated tech, you’ll quickly find yourself drowning in complex administrative tasks across multiple locations.
Tools for centralized member management
Get
real-time visibility into your members’ activities
across all locations. With member management software, you’ll be able to see member engagement patterns at a glance, or easily identify members who might be at risk of churning.
Another practical use case for this software is analyzing which programs and/or services perform best at each location so you can double-down on what works and fix what doesn’t.

How ABC Glofox Uses Data to Boost Your Business Growth
Consideration #3: Make Data-Driven Financial Decisions
Running one successful fitness business is tough enough. Make sure you’ve mastered your numbers (like the ones listed below) before you expand. They’ll tell you if you’re ready to grow or if you need to strengthen what you’ve already built.
Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
This is your predictable monthly income from memberships. Hold off on expansion if your MRR isn’t growing steadily for at least 6 months. You need stable cash flow before taking on another location’s rent and expenses.
Member churn rate
How many of your members cancel each month? If you’re losing more than 5% monthly, prioritize fixing this issue before expanding. Opening a new location won’t solve retention problems. Unfortunately, it’ll just give you twice as many members to lose.

How Glofox’s AI Can Mitigate Member Churn and Boost Retention
Gross profit margin
What percentage of revenue is left after paying instructors and your direct costs? You need at least 60% for a healthy fitness business. Lower margins than this mean your classes aren’t profitable enough to replicate elsewhere.
Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
Exactly how much does it cost to get one new member through your doors? This number often increases with new locations. If you don’t know your CAC down to the penny, you’re not ready to scale.

Net profit margin
Your actual profit after all expenses. Aim for at least 10% consistently. Without this cushion, unexpected expansion costs—and there are
always
unexpected costs—could sink your business.
Utilization rate
What percentage of
your class spots
and equipment time gets used? Below 70% means you have room to grow without expanding. Max out your current space before paying for more.
Average revenue per member (ARPM)
Total revenue divided by total members. Low ARPM means you’re not maximizing the value of your current members through
personal training
, retail, or add-on services. Get this right before trying to duplicate.
Break-even point
The exact number of members needed
to cover all costs
. Calculate this for your new location before signing anything. Can you realistically hit this number in 6 months? If you’re not sure, keep planning.
What it comes down to:
Scaling won’t fix these numbers if they aren’t strong at your current location. Get your first location running smoothly, then use these metrics as your expansion readiness checklist.
Tracking these metrics manually through spreadsheets can eat up hours of your week—
time you should spend growing your business
. That’s where the right fitness management software makes all the difference. ABC Glofox’s
reporting dashboard
puts these critical numbers at your fingertips, updating in real-time so you always know where your business stands.
You’ll no longer have to guess if you’re ready to scale. You’ll have the data to prove it. 👍

Align your messaging everywhere
Your social media, email campaigns, and in-studio communications need to speak with one voice. Mixed messages confuse members and weaken your market position. Create

How do you successfully manage multiple fitness studio locations without losing service quality?
Start with rock-solid SOPs that document exactly how things should run. Train your staff consistently across all locations. Then use
technology
to keep tabs on what’s happening everywhere—member engagement, class attendance, revenue, etc.—without having to drive to different locations. Regular check-ins and member surveys help catch small issues before they become bigger problems.
How can technology help multi-location fitness operators grow at scale?
The right software is your business command center. You’ll get one dashboard that shows member activity, payments, and performance across all locations.
ABC Glofox
helps do the heavy lifting by putting member management, billing, scheduling, and reporting in one place—so you spend less time on admin and more time growing your business.
Is franchising or corporate ownership better for fitness business expansion?
It depends on what you’re after. Corporate ownership gives you complete control; every location runs exactly how you want. But you’ll need more capital and management bandwidth to get started.
Franchising helps you grow faster with other people’s money, but you’ll have less control over day-to-day operations.
Most successful operators choose based on their available capital, desired growth timeline, and comfort level with giving up some control.

Gym usage is up
60% on pre-pandemic levels
, and up to
29% of people
have a personal trainer or coach. Overall, people are seeing gyms and fitness centers as the new “third place” in their lives. What does this mean? Other than work and home, people spend most of their time at the gym either working out or socializing.
Although the market may be crowded, it has never been a better time to set up a gym or fitness business. Demand is the highest it’s ever been, and it’s only set to grow.
But how much does it cost to open a gym?
The startup costs for opening a gym business can vary massively depending on the size, location, facility, and the type of gym you plan on launching. The basic start-up costs can range from
$10,000 to $50,000 on average
. However, the cost can exceed this also.  Note that it’s almost impossible to give an entirely accurate estimation that represents all gyms. Different gym owners set up different types of gym businesses, and the startup costs will differ depending on the facility.
Planning out your financing is crucial to success and managing your business long-term. In this article, we will be discussing topics such as property and facility costs, buying equipment, operational costs and so much more.
It’s a solid rule of thumb that most fitness businesses will not make money within their first year of opening, so it’s important that you have a solid runway of funding available to you.
Don’t have time to read the whole article?
Here’s a summary of what’s below:
Accurate financing is the most important thing when it comes to the success of your fitness business.
Accurate financing can actually make you money, thanks to interest from investors and stopping mistakes before they happen.
Investing in quality gym reporting software can save you thousands of dollars every year.
It pays to prepare; always keep a rainy day fund for emergencies and unseen expenses.
Overall, expect to pay
around $10,000 for a small fitness business, and closer to $150,000 for a big-box gym.

How ABC Glofox can be the fitness business partner you need
The Complete Cost of Opening a Gym
Your Gym Premises and Facilities
One of the most expensive and essential decisions is the location of your gym. This will form the bulk of your operational costs. In reality, it will be one of the most significant costs in your business plan. Your location needs to be worth the cost in terms of getting foot traffic through the door. Street visibility is crucial if you don’t plan on spending a lot on marketing but will cost more each month. The cost can even vary widely within cities, let alone throughout the U.S.
Before making a decision, you need to conduct thorough research on multiple locations. Think clearly about your potential gym members and what will suit them. For example, being located next to a health market will do more for your business than being next to a warehouse. You’ll need to think about whether you’ll be renting or purchasing the building and factor this into your plan. To get an idea of numbers, a 2,000 sq ft space would cost roughly $6,000 per month to rent.
The next question is whether your space comes ready or if it needs a little work. Do you want to include showers, a yoga studio, set up CCTV or does it just need redecorating? All these things come at a price and the majority of the time it’s not cheap. You’ll need to factor into your budget the cost of any building or remodeling that needs to be done to add additional facilities. Depending on what you need to do you could be looking at thousands of dollars extra.
To run a gym, you need the lights on and the music turned up so it’s no surprise that it eats up a lot of electricity and water. Consider any upfront deposits you’ll need for utilities including gas, sewer, water, and electric. This could be around $6500 for a medium-scale standard gym. This is not only an upfront cost to think about but an ongoing cost so factor this into your budget
Gym Equipment
Like the location of your business, the price range of gym equipment can have a broad spectrum. First, you need to determine what type of gym or fitness center you’re looking to create. If you plan on running classes, you’ll need to have enough gym equipment so that every person in the class has a machine. If you’re a personal trainer or have years of experience in the fitness industry, you’ll likely have a good idea of this.
The cost can vary from filling out a personal studio of around 1,500 sq ft for $10,000 to a fully kitted out commercial gym for $50,000. Commercial gyms usually take up approximately 3,000 to 4,000 sq ft. Be sure to shop around and do your research, will you be paying a one-off cost or leasing your gym equipment? There are pros and cons for both, so you’ll need to decide which option works better for your business.

The Complete Gym Equipment Guide
Another point to consider when thinking about your finances is your gym supplies, furniture, and gadgets. Your clients will expect your business to be properly decked out with towels, chairs, and flat-screen TVs. Other items to consider are telephones, printers, sound systems, and computers, all of which you need to run your gym properly.

Licenses and Permits
When just starting out, there are several costs to consider that will come from acquiring the right licenses, permits, and certifications that your business needs. If you don’t already have one, gym owners should think of applying for personal trainers’ certification. Having a certified and accredited staff is important. You’ll need to hire already qualified trainers or cover the costs of training of up to $800 per qualification.
The style and focus of each person’s trainer qualification should be a significant factor in which one you choose. Organizations offering some of the top training qualifications include:
American Council on Exercise (ACE)
National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM)
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA)
International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA)
One of the significant licenses you’ll need as a gym owner is a business license. The cost can vary depending on how many employees you have but expect to pay no more than a few hundred dollars. Where you’re based can impact what permits you need to have in place. Health and safety permits and compliances need to be in place and aren’t something you should skimp on.

10 Barriers Holding Your Business Back
Legal Fees and Business Insurance
There are plenty of commercial and legal fees that you will need to pay before your gym is set up, so factor this into your budget. You’ll need to pay for the cost of applying for a business license. As well as that you need to register a new business with local authorities and trade name registration. Task lawyers with the job of writing up business contracts, membership contracts, and setting up legal documents. However, all of this can come up at a high price.
To start with you will need several documents like a Certificate of Incorporation and Employment Agreements. It’s recommended you hire or at least consult a lawyer for this. Expect to pay around $200 per hour for these kinds of services. Although the cost can vary depending on the legal documents you require, expect to rack up to approximately $15,000 in legal fees for a medium-scale gym.
Gyms deal with a large amount of traffic and are no doubt prone to on-site injury. You’ll need to have business insurance in place to cover several different possibilities. This includes general liability, theft, workers’ compensation, and property casualty insurance. Even if you have a bulletproof membership contract and waiver, you still may get an angry client on your hands if they’ve injured themselves on your premises. For a small gym with one desk clerk and no more than $100,000 worth of gym equipment, expect to pay up to $6,000.

Gym Financing Explained
Employee Salaries
Unless you plan on running your business alone, there’s a good chance you’ll be hiring dedicated staff to look after certain aspects of the company. From personal trainers and business managers to accountants, your employees will help you run your business. Although this isn’t a huge initial cost, it does mount up over time and will take up a big chunk of the gyms’ operating costs.
Remember that top-level trainers attract new customers but don’t come cheap. As a new business owner, you’ll be faced with managing all aspects of the business. Even if you’re an expert accountant or know the law, hiring a professional lawyer and accountant helps take the weight off.
Make sure to have the first few months of employee wages in the bank as you’re unlikely to be turning a profit in this time. After paying your employees’ wages and covering the rest of your monthly costs, if there’s anything left over, then you get paid! It’s a solid assumption that you won’t be getting paid very much or at all in at least the first year. This is why it’s so important to have a financial cushion as you still need to survive and pay bills.

Gym Management Software and Hardware
There is an entire market that is dedicated to
gym management software.
This will deal with everything including check-ins, billing, administration tasks, membership renewals, reporting, insights, and the day-to-day management of the gym. The majority of gym management software is on a subscription basis. This could be monthly, quarterly, or yearly
so you’ll need to factor that into the budget. Prices can vary massively depending on how in-depth the service is.
You’ll also need to set up the internet and a point-of-sale system that can accept different forms of payment. The cost of the hardware setup can vary depending on the provider you choose. Expect to pay up to $2,500 per year with a larger initial cost to get you started.
Choosing the right software and hardware for your business that suits your needs is just one part of creating your business. Here’s

founder of

, explaining the benefits of gym management software
Advertising and Marketing
Your advertising and marketing efforts are essential to getting the word out there. You need to let your target market know that you are open for business. Where you focus your marketing efforts will dictate the cost. There are initial costs involved such as building your business website and hosting. You could go down the avenue of creating this yourself using a do-it-yourself site like
Squarespace
or
WordPress
. The other option is to hire a professional.  With this, you will be looking at a minimum of $300 to create your new site.
Other costs to consider include flyer printing and signage. If you head down a more traditional route of handing out flyers, you should expect to pay around $100 for 2,000 flyers. If you’re stocking merchandise like gym apparel, this is another cost to factor into your finances.
In terms of marketing, building a social media following and setting up social media accounts should be a priority. Instagram and Facebook are key channels in the fitness industry, so focus your efforts on building a community here. Consider launching a Facebook or Instagram campaign to spread the word about your gym. You can also use Google Ads to get your website in front of new customers. The budget for these types of campaigns can vary. Check out

Why You Need a Fitness Management Platform
As you can tell, there are so many different elements to think about when opening a gym. This is why the cost of opening a gym can vary so much from case to case. By taking into account each part, you can start drawing up an estimate of the initial investment your business will need and where that money will come from.
Always think about unforeseen expenses when figuring out your finances. We can’t stress enough the importance of a financial safety net when it comes to starting a new venture. Like any business, it’ll take hard work, sweat, and probably a fair amount of tears but it will be worth it in the end to achieve your goals. For more information on opening a gym business read

Why Fast, Smooth Onboarding Matters for New Gym Owners
When you’re
launching a new studio
,
every day counts
. The faster you can open your doors and start welcoming members, the sooner you begin generating revenue and building momentum.
But speed isn’t everything
. A smooth onboarding experience sets the tone for how you’ll run your business for
years
to come. Get it right from the start, and you’ll have systems that work properly as you grow. Rush through setup
without
proper planning, and you’ll spend months fixing problems that could have been avoided.
Good client onboarding software does three critical things for new studio owners.
First, it
reduces your time to launch
by eliminating manual setup tasks and giving you plug-and-play templates that work right out of the box.
Second, it
prevents costly mistakes
by guiding you through each step of the configuration process.
Lastly, it
creates a professional first impression
with your members, showing them you’re organized and ready to deliver an exceptional experience.
Getting dedicated support can be the difference between launching in three weeks versus three months. That time savings is huge when you’re eager to get going.
How to Develop Successful Customer Onboarding Processes
Whether you’re onboarding new software or welcoming new members, the principles of successful onboarding remain the same. Great customer onboarding software creates a clear path forward, eliminates confusion, and makes people feel supported every step of the way.
Here are the key building blocks that form the basis of a great onboarding experience:
Understand your customers.
Before you do anything, get to know what obstacles and challenges your new members face. Use these insights to create tailored solutions that address their specific needs and pain points.
Develop your
communication strategy
.
Decide on a channel your members use regularly, whether email, SMS, push notifications, or a combination of them. Then
automate your messaging
to keep new members engaged, informed, and motivated without overwhelming your team.
Create customer-focused goals.
Getting new members integrated into your studio should be a top priority for
retention
. During the onboarding process, it’s important to help new members set realistic, achievable goals using frameworks like SMART goals. Schedule one-on-one appointments to understand their fitness level and match them with the right resources. Group classes are another effective way to get members plugged into the community.
Build a knowledge hub.
Don’t let lack of information deter members from sticking around. Create a reliable source of information for your members in the form of blog posts, video tutorials, or guides. Answer the most common questions newcomers have about working out at your studio.
Evaluate and adjust.
First, identify key metrics like churn rate, satisfaction, and
engagement
. Second, check these metrics at regular intervals to see what’s working and what needs improvement, then optimize your onboarding process over time.

So, What’s Next?
TL;DR
: Managing day to day operations comes down to tracking essential KPIs and using fitness dashboards to gain real-time insights into the health of your business. ABC Glofox simplifies this process, helping single- and multi-location gym owners save time and make data-driven decisions that improve performance and drive growth.
You open the gym at 5 a.m. for early morning classes. By 6 a.m., you’re troubleshooting a
billing issue
. At 7 a.m., you’re responding to member emails. By noon, you’re interviewing a new instructor while simultaneously trying to figure out why last month’s retention numbers dropped.
Sound familiar?
Your gym needs to run on more than passion to be successful. The reality is that
day to day operations
can make or break your business. Between scheduling classes, tracking revenue,
managing staff
, and keeping your members happy, the operational side of gym ownership often gets overwhelming.
The good news? The right systems and processes can transform your daily grind into a smooth operation. In this guide, we’ll break down the essential franchise KPIs every gym should track, explore how fitness dashboards simplify data management, and show you why pro-level reporting tools aren’t just for big chains anymore.

Day to Day Operations: KPIs Every Gym Should Track
Understanding your gym’s performance starts with
tracking the right metrics
. KPIs (
Key Performance Indicators
) give you a clear picture of your business health and help you make smarter decisions instead of relying on gut feeling.
Here are the essential franchise KPIs that every gym owner should monitor:
Member retention rate
This metric shows the percentage of members
who stay with your gym over a specific period
.
Example: If you started January with 200 members and ended with 180, your retention rate is 90%.
High retention
means your members are satisfied and your gym is
sticky
.
Low retention
signals you need to improve the member experience. Tracking this metric monthly helps you spot trends over time and proactively address issues.
Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
MRR
represents the
predictable revenue your gym generates each month from memberships.
So if you have 100 members paying $150 per month, your MRR is $15,000.
This number indicates whether your business is
growing, stable,
or
declining
. It’s the most important financial metric for planning expenses, hiring staff, and making investment decisions.
Average revenue per member (ARPU)
ARPU
indicates the average revenue generated by each member
.
You can calculate ARPU by dividing total revenue by total number of members. If your gym made $20,000 last month from 100 members, your ARPU is $200.
This metric helps you understand
if your
pricing strategy
is effective
and whether
upselling services
, such as personal training or nutrition coaching, is successful.
Class/session utilization rates
This metric measures
how full your classes are compared to capacity
.
For instance, if your 6 a.m. spin class has 20 spots but only 8 people show up, that’s a 40% utilization rate.
High utilization
means you’re meeting demand.
Low utilization
might mean you need to adjust class times, improve your marketing, or reconsider which classes you offer. This data helps prevent you from paying instructors for empty classes.

Lead conversion rate
This data point tracks
the percentage of inquiries that become paying members
. If 50 people tour your gym and 10 sign up, your conversion rate is 20%.
A
strong conversion rate
means your sales process is working as intended. A
weak rate
signals problems with pricing,
sales skills
, or how you showcase your gym’s value. Improving this metric directly impacts your bottom line without spending more on marketing.
Why tracking these KPIs keeps small gyms competitive
Far from just numbers on a spreadsheet, these metrics indicate the health of your business and pinpoint exactly where it needs support.
When you track them consistently, you’re in a position to spot problems early, capitalize on opportunities quickly, and make decisions based on data instead of guesswork.
The difference between struggling gyms and successful ones often comes down to who’s watching the numbers.

Fitness Dashboards and Data Tracking for SMBs
Raw data means nothing if you can’t understand it quickly. That’s where fitness dashboards come in.
A good dashboard turns your gym’s performance data into
easy-to-understand visual information
you can access anytime, anywhere. So instead of digging through spreadsheets or waiting for month-end reports, you can get real-time insights at a glance.
Some examples of fitness dashboards for managing day to day business operations:
Membership reports
show active members, new sign-ups, cancellations, and retention trends. You can see exactly who’s staying and who’s leaving.
Revenue reports
break down income by source, including memberships, personal training, retail, and more. You’ll know which services drive the most profit.
Leads conversion reports
track your pipeline from inquiry to conversion. You can identify where potential members drop off in your sales process and coach your team accordingly.
Class performance reports
reveal which classes are popular, which are underperforming, and when your gym is busiest. This data helps you adjust your gym class schedule accordingly..
Fitness dashboards save you hours of manual data entry and provide instant visibility into what’s working and what needs attention.

Fitness Studio Tech Stack – Essential Tools for Success
Why SMBs Need Pro-Level Reporting Tools
Many small gym owners start with basic tools like spreadsheets and notebooks to track what’s happening in their business. Unfortunately, these manual methods can create real problems as
your business grows
.
Let’s break it down:
Manual spreadsheets are
time-consuming
and
prone to errors
. One wrong formula and your revenue projections can be off by thousands.
Plus,
your data lives in multiple places
—membership info in one system, billing in another, class schedules somewhere else. This fragmentation makes it nearly impossible to see the complete picture of your business.
Inconsistent data
becomes another headache. When three different spreadsheets show three different numbers, which one is right? You waste valuable time reconciling numbers instead of growing your business. And you might make decisions based on inaccurate information.

How ABC Glofox Uses Data to Boost Your Business Growth
FAQs – Gym Operations and Reporting
What are day to day operations?
Day to day operations refer to the routine tasks and activities required to keep your business running smoothly.
For gyms, this includes opening and closing the facility, managing
member check-ins
, responding to inquiries, scheduling and running
classes
, handling billing and payments, addressing member questions, managing staff schedules, and maintaining equipment.
Day to day operations are the essential activities that happen every single day to deliver value to your members and keep your business functioning.
What does the day to day operation of a gym actually involve?
Running a gym involves juggling multiple responsibilities at once.
Your morning might start with unlocking the facility and greeting early members. You’ll troubleshoot
equipment issues
, answer phone calls and emails from prospective members, and ensure your scheduled classes have instructors.
Throughout the day, you’re
processing payments
, managing cancellations, monitoring class attendance, and addressing member questions or feedback.
You’re also handling administrative tasks like updating member records, reviewing financial reports, posting on social media, and
following up with leads
.
Staff management takes up significant time—creating schedules, conducting training, and addressing performance issues. And that’s just the operational side. You’re also thinking strategically about retention, growth, and how to improve the member experience.
The reality is that gym owners and managers wear many hats, and the daily demands can be overwhelming without proper systems in place.

How do fitness dashboards help with daily gym management?
Fitness dashboards provide instant visibility into
your operations
.
For instance,
reporting dashboards
let you see everything in real-time instead of waiting for end-of-month reports or manually pulling data from multiple systems. This allows you to identify problems as they happen and fix them immediately.
So if your dashboard shows that
10 members haven’t visited in two weeks
, you can reach out to them today with a personalized message. If
class attendance
drops suddenly, you can investigate and adjust before the trend continues.
Fitness dashboards also help with
staff management
. You can see which of your instructors are fully booked and which need more members assigned to them.
The visual nature of fitness dashboards makes complex data easy to understand at a glance. Plus, you don’t need to be a data analyst to know if your gym is performing well. Green numbers going up? Good. Red numbers going down? Time to take action.
What reporting tools do franchises use to track multiple gym locations?
Multi-location operators need reporting tools that provide both consolidated views and location-specific data.
ABC Glofox’s
centralized dashboards
show performance across all gyms, making it easy for you to compare locations and identify which ones are thriving and which need support.
At the same time, individual location managers need access to their own data to manage day to day operations effectively. Our platform addresses both needs.
The best reporting tools allow regional leaders to set benchmarks and track each location’s performance against company-wide goals. They also enable HQ to maintain brand consistency while giving individual locations flexibility to adapt to their local markets.

How can SMB gyms use regional reporting to improve performance?
Regional reporting is valuable even for
smaller gyms
with just two or three locations.
By comparing performance across sites, you can
identify best practices
and
replicate what works
. If Location A has a 95% retention rate and Location B has 80%, what’s the difference? Better communication? Stronger community? More engaged staff? Regional reporting helps you answer these questions.
You can also use regional data to
optimize how you allocate resources.
If one location consistently has high class utilization while another struggles, it’s time to shift instructors or adjust class schedules. Regional reporting ensures you’re not treating all locations the same when they have different needs and opportunities.
For franchise operators, regional reporting also helps ensure
brand consistency across locations
while still allowing individual locations to adapt to local market conditions. Reporting makes it easier to ensure that all locations meet minimum performance standards while giving high-performing locations the recognition they deserve.

Glofox App

Go to your “Member’s List” and on the right hand side you will see a set of filters. You can use the filter called “Last Booking” to isolate the members who have not made a booking over a specific period of time. You can then use the push notification tool to send a free message to just those customers. A great way to make sure that you don’t lose their business!!
5. Recurring Payments
With Glofox, you can avoid late payments and lost revenue by using your gym management software to set up recurring payments that bill automatically for your members, whether that be weekly, monthly or annually- you set the rules.
By simplifying payments for loyal customers, you’re giving them a greater experience, keeping them happy and committed, while simultaneously stabilizing your cashflow. Sounds good eh?

5 Key Tips for Boosting Your Business Performance
1. Don’t Leave Gaps Between the Sales and Onboarding
It’s easy to think that the member journey starts when the person walks in the door. In reality, however, onboarding a member correctly has its origins in the sales process. The salesperson does a great job of building a relationship with the customer. In the long run, though, they will not be building a
long-term
relationship with the customer.
There is a gap between where the salesperson’s job ends and the onboarding person’s job begins. Within this gap, the new member can feel lost and the good relationship built up with the salesperson can lessen in value. According to Dr. Bedford, there needs to be an overlap so there is smooth continuity in the person’s journey from converted lead to fully onboarded member.
You need to take the time to introduce them to staff, familiarize them with your property, business hours, and events – without it, they could walk out the door and you may never see them again.

2. Create a Watertight Onboarding Plan
There is no “one size fits all” when it comes to a member joining your gym. Dr. Bedford explains the three types of members you would typically find signing up for a gym membership. They are:
The New Member:
A person who has never really joined a gym before.
The Savvy Member:
This person is an experienced gym-goer who largely knows what they are doing.
The Yo-Yo Member:
Someone who has been a regular member of a gym at least once before but has not committed to it long-term.
The mistake some gyms make is that the Yo-Yo Member is treated as a Savvy Member as they answer “yes” to the question “Have you ever been a member of a gym before?” when they really should be treated as a new member. Then they will get the support needed to ensure they don’t leave.
Dr. Bedford points out that your onboarding team needs to be able to identify who needs more support and who needs less. This means asking the right questions that make the customer self-select their category rather than the trainer. Then allocate the proper resources to back up each level of support.

3. Map Out The Customer Journey
Getting the touchpoints right is so important to getting your customer journey right. Then one thing you should not do is bombard them constantly with sales messaging as they will quickly disengage. What you need to do is map out the touchpoints in the customer journey based on what the member is expecting.
Dr. Bedford gives a quick overview of what this playbook looks like in reality. First of all, map out the timeline of the journey from the sales process onwards. Then identify what the customer service is at each stage and what the emotional experience is at these stages. Finally, you need to think of means of communication, be it SMS, email, or a combination of both.

4. You Need to Develop Your Online Product
Something that has been echoed recently by a few of our recent guests is that the quality of your recording needs to evolve over time. In the beginning, current members will be forgiving about technical hiccups but may not be after day 20. Similarly, new members will not be as patient if your online product is not up to scratch. It’s essential to learn and develop your recorded workouts and figure out quickly what works and what doesn’t.
An example Dr. Bedford points out is that some instructors will be great on-screen while others are more suited to in-person classes. He also references an article by Life Fitness Director of Digital Experience Leon Rudge which says there are some things that you can get away with in a crisis but that can’t be your long-term strategy. You need to figure out how to get the best out of your team and resources to deliver an online offering that shines.

5. Implementing a Retention Strategy Across A Franchise
If you are the head of a franchise, it’s never been more important to make sure there is cohesion across all your locations. Retaining members in this new world is the key to survival so everyone needs to be on the same page. Once you have developed the playbook for retention, you need a way to get all your franchise locations onboard.
Dr. Bedford explains that you need to show them clearly the data that proves the value of your retention playbook. This is not just from a customer experience standpoint, but from a bottom-line standpoint. On top of this, franchise owners need to ensure that their managers understand and deliver on the process that has been mapped out.

4 Tips to Improve Your Push Notification Strategy
10 Push Notification Ideas to Increase Retention
A Quick Introduction to How Push Notifications Work
A push notification is a short message or alert that pops up on a user’s device when someone has installed your app and agreed to receive your push notifications. You can use them as a way to keep customers updated, encourage class bookings, and send class reminders. Mobile application publishers can send users push notifications at any time. The user doesn’t need to be signed in or even on your app to receive an alert. Push notifications can be displayed on the lock screen and found in the notification center for iPhone users.
Mobile push notifications are specifically for phone and tablet users, while web push notifications are for desktop or laptop users. Browsers such as Chrome and Firefox have pop-up push notifications that notify users with certain messages. Not every mobile device supports web push notifications. For example, Android users don’t get web push messages when using Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.
App push notifications look similar to an SMS text message but are only sent to users who install your app and opt-in to receive messages. You can send push notifications on various mobile devices like Apple, Android devices, Blackberry, and Windows.
The notifications were first introduced in 2009 for iOS devices. Other major phone platforms soon rolled out push notifications following this. Depending on the phone operating system, the push notification can look a little different and have different character limits. But, in general, your alert message contains the following:
Title (ideal limit of 39 characters)
Small icon
Body of text (ideally 10 words or fewer)
Time received
Mobile app name
How Can Push Notifications Increase Member Retention
You can use mobile push notifications as a marketing and retention tool. Push notifications give you the opportunity to update members immediately and stay in contact. You can alert customers on any cancellations and updates as they happen. Send class reminders and motivate members.
Unlike messages, which can sometimes get lost in between chat windows, your alerts will be on the device your members use the most. Push notifications can be a valuable tool for retaining members and keeping class attendance high. You can strategically send push messages to drive value, sales, and retention.
You can use push notifications in several ways to increase retention. For example, if a member missed their spin class, you can send a timely and gentle reminder with a friendly notification that you “miss them and can’t wait to see them next time”. By sending a class reminder 30 minutes before, you could increase class attendance and retention by driving value.
Push notifications are an effective tool in mobile marketing. But it’s important that your overall in-app experience is of a high standard. Push notifications are used as part of your overall retention and marketing strategy, rather than a standalone tool.
4 Tips to Improve Your Push Notification Strategy
Push notifications rely on real-time triggers to send immediate alerts with dynamic content. They are a cost-effective form of communication and compared to SMS messages, are relatively inexpensive. So, it’s an ideal channel for sending messages to a huge list of app users. However, you can’t just roll out push notifications and expect a good uptick of response and action. Here are four best practices to follow to improve your push notification strategy and make the most of your alerts.
Define Your Target Audience
If you want to increase your open rate and maximize your push notifications, you need to define your target audience. Through target audience segmentation, you can deliver targeted push messaging. To split up your audience base, look at defining factors like purchase history, age, favorite class, and attendance.
Timing is Everything
When is the best time to send a push notification? Unfortunately, there isn’t a perfect answer to this question. The best time to send your alert comes down to your purpose and the relevancy of your content. For example, a class reminder should be sent 30 minutes before the session begins. But, if you push marketing messages too often, you run the risk of over messaging your membership base. Whenever you send a message, it should add value and improve the customer experience.

Keep it Short and Sweet
While there is no exact magic formula for writing a push notification, the general consensus is the shorter, the better. Writing a captivating push notification is similar to creating an
engaging fitness email subject line
. It needs to be short, sweet, clear, and persuasive. Although different platforms have varying character limits, the ideal length is 10 words or fewer. The number of words on the screen will vary depending on the type of device, so this is another reason to keep your alerts short and concise.
Always Add Value
Your messages should always be relevant to the participant and add value. Brands who have the most success are the ones who have acquired enough customer data so that they can send super relevant messages and valuable content. This goes beyond just addressing the customer with their first name. You want to use data to send notifications that add value to the customer experience, instead of potentially damaging the relationship and causing the user to uninstall your app.
10 Push Notification Ideas to Increase Retention
Push notifications can help you to continue to build relationships with members outside of the gym. Relationships are based on creating personal and human connections. By delivering relevant and valuable messages, you can increase retention and improve the user experience. Here are 10 push notifications ideas to boost your retention rate.
1. Offer Promotions
Push notifications can be a great sales tool for marketers. You can send promotional offers and upsell to existing members. What’s important is that you send offers that are relevant and add value. For example, if a member had previously purchased a block of classes from you and you were running a sale on bulk class passes, this would be a relevant promotional offer. Not only does it increase sales, but also member retention. The key to success is strategically sending offers and discounts to encourage customers to participate without being too pushy or over sending multiple offers.
2. Encourage Class Booking
You can encourage both active and inactive members to book a class. For an active user, a good push notification would be notifying them of a star guest fitness instructor for their most booked class. On the other hand, to encourage inactive members to book, you can send regular updates on new classes, virtual streaming, and on-demand fitness options. You can send motivational messages and try to pique their interest and take action. There are many reasons why members become inactive. Communication is key to retaining members.
3. Celebrate Milestones
Celebrating milestones and achievements is a fantastic way to motivate members and show them their progress. You can celebrate a range of milestones including member anniversary, weight loss, number of classes attended, and beating a personal best. These types of push notifications are triggered by a certain behavior or action. That means, the message is entirely relevant to the current situation and makes the member feel good about themselves. When training, it’s easy to become complacent when you don’t see progress every day. By celebrating milestones, you can keep motivation levels high and retain members for longer.
4. Make it Personal
Whatever message you’re sending, make it personal. Impersonal and irrelevant messages will quickly cause members to opt out of your communication. Although some notifications are general such as a facility update or new COVID-19 protocols, the majority of content should be personalized. For example, you should only send your post-natal yoga class updates to the relevant target audience. When signing up for your services, often members have a favorite class or specific goal they are looking to achieve. Use their members history and the data you have available to keep it relevant and personalize the content.
5. Fitness Challenges
You can integrate push notifications into your fitness challenge communication strategy.
Fitness challenges can supercharge your retention
and create a friendly sense of competition between members. They are easy to organize and offer a great incentive for members to move, hit their goals, and compete against friends. You can use push notifications to inform members about upcoming fitness challenges. Send reminders to input any challenge data and find out where they stand in the challenge. Fitness challenges can be as simple or complex as you like from hydration challenges to an eight-week program.
6. Weekly Weigh-In Reminder
Staying motivated and being held accountable are two essential factors in retaining members. One way to increase both of these is a weekly weigh-in. When members are doing well, they feel motivated. On the other hand, when users have had a bad week, it can hold them accountable. You have a couple of options for your push notifications here. One is to remind users to enter their weekly weigh-in data if they have forgotten. The other is to send a congratulatory or motivational message after. Even if they have put on weight, it’s an opportunity to link to a valuable piece of content so that they can crush the next week.
7. Upcoming Class Reminders
Automation for class reminders is a great way to
increase group fitness attendance
and boost retention. It’s easy to forget about classes, especially when you book in advance. When you send class reminders, it has two benefits. Firstly, it reminds members they booked a class in the first place, so they are more likely to show up. Secondly, it gives members a chance to cancel if they can no longer attend and opens up the class to more bookings. Class reminders are essential to any fitness business.
8. New Service Announcement
Do you have a new class running? Or have you upgraded your gym equipment and installed something brand new and innovative? Either way, push notifications work well for announcing new services and offerings. Keep it short, sweet, and concise. New classes and guest fitness instructors mix up your training variety and can help to re-engage members who have become a little inactive.
9. Ask for Feedback
No one knows your customers more than they do. Knowing what your members think and want are key to constant improvement. You can send quick surveys or ask members to rate your app with one button and even leave a comment. The best way to ask for feedback is after certain behaviors. For example, ask what they thought of a workout after completing a class. You can use feedback to improve multiple parts of your business, marketing, and member experience.
In Summary
By refining your push notifications and tailoring messages to your target audience, you can improve your overall push notification strategy. Experiment with times and frequency to pinpoint where you can improve. That way, you can put your efforts into messages that have the most success. Push notifications can help to strengthen customer relationships, boost the member experience, and increase retention.

By creating an exclusive space to nurture lasting customer relationships, you can tap into the power of Facebook groups. You can provide value to your customers without sounding salesly or spammy.

By understanding how you can use Facebook groups, you can begin to craft your online community, add value to your customers, and drive traffic to your website.

11 tips for using and growing engaged Facebook groups for business
What are Facebook groups?
More than one billion people use Facebook groups
and over 100 million people are part of “meaningful groups”. Considering that Facebook is home to
2.89 billion monthly active users
, the social media platform is a marketing asset with a huge global reach.
Facebook groups for business are all about building a great community, so keep this in mind as you produce and publish content. When it comes to Facebook marketing, it’s important to think about what you can do to create your community. As you provide value to your group members, it helps to increase brand awareness and even inspire people so that everyone wins.
So, what are Facebook groups? They are an online community. Your Facebook business page and group are two very different assets:
Facebook page – this is your company’s profile page that’s public. It includes elements like your business information, opening times, reviews, content, and even your shop. By default, all Facebook pages are public.
Facebook group – a group is slightly different as it’s a place where members join to connect with each other with more regular engagement. The focus is on interaction and forming relationships with both customers and allowing customers to connect.
Your Facebook group is a community centered around a topic or common interest for like-minded people that’s usually hosted by your Facebook page. There are three different types of group settings:
Public – as the name suggests, anyone can find a public Facebook group. If you search for the group, you would be able to see who is in the group, the posts, and the discussions. Members will still need to request to join your group to participate in the conversation, but they can see everything as a non-member.
Private and visible – these groups used to be called closed groups, but are now private and visible. So, you can search for the group but members have to be approved before they can see any content or discussions. All they can see is group information, members, and group history. You can choose to accept or deny member requests.
Private and hidden – these groups used to be called secret groups. They can only be seen by members or those who have been invited to the group. Only members can see the content beyond the group information, members, and history.
Most businesses tend to opt for private Facebook groups that are visible. That way, customers can find you but they can’t see all your content until you accept them as a member. You have complete control over what members and non-members can see which gives you the ability to optimize content for the group and still be searchable. If you want to set up a super-exclusive Facebook group or post more controversial content, you may opt for a private and hidden group.
Why use Facebook groups?
Whether you’re a small local business owner, entrepreneur, or mammoth online retailer, Facebook is a powerful digital marketing tool. With a huge reach and complex targeting tools, nowadays, Facebook is a part of any effective marketing strategy. Although Facebook groups are a little different from the usual
Facebook ads
, it offers several benefits for businesses.
As part of your marketing strategy, Facebook groups can be effective for building long-lasting relationships with customers. Because a group has the power to create a community, your brand becomes more valuable to customers. Communities are crucial for long-term success as they help to increase brand awareness and loyalty.
Creating and managing Facebook groups requires time and effort. Groups can boost your organic reach and help you to develop more meaningful relationships with customers. Group content tends to have a much better organic reach than standard Facebook pages. When members join a group they opt-in to see your content so it shows in their newsfeed, driving engagement and traffic to your group. With Facebook pages, you’re reliant on the platform’s algorithms to show your content and notifications to your followers. Often, you have to pay for followers to see that content. If a follower hasn’t interacted with your previous posts, it’s unlikely that your Facebook page post will show in their newsfeed.
Businesses can use Facebook groups in a variety of ways; here are some ideas:
Customer support group
Offer exclusive content
Discuss current events
Feedback forum

11 tips for using and growing engaged Facebook groups for business
Facebook groups are a valuable tool for small businesses. They can drive value, create a sense of community, and increase brand awareness. By sticking to a few best practices and implementing some of the tips below, you can begin to grow an engaged Facebook group your members will love.
1. Set your group rules and expectations
Before accepting or inviting members to your group, consider your group rules and expectations. Set some rules for an inclusive and respectful environment. You can enter up to ten rules in the “moderate group” section of the group settings. It could include your terms of service, behavior, or appropriate topics. This section is all about setting the tone for the conversation. It’s down to group admins to enforce the rules after setting them by removing posts or banning members that don’t follow the rules.
2. Create a customer support group
Customer service is crucial for any business and creating the kind of reputation that attracts customers. One way you can use Facebook groups for business is through additional customer support. When members can speak to you directly to solve any issues or ask for help, it’s valuable. Whether it’s technical glitches or a product issue, you can solve a problem privately while helping several members at the same time.
3. Educate and teach users
A Facebook group is a great platform to educate and teach users about a relevant topic, product, or brand in general. Both you and your ambassadors can post within the group to drive even more value to customers. Maybe you can share a course for your members to help solve a specific problem or live video stream an interview with an expert in the field. Either way, you can produce and share content that’s entirely relevant to your membership base.
4. Get members talking daily
As a community-driven platform, try to encourage members to respond and engage with your posts. Think about posting regular welcome messages, especially if you have an influx of new customers. The aim is to create a friendly and welcoming environment for all customers. When crafting your content strategy, think about posting content that will get your members talking and responding to posts. Although you can engage with members of the group, try not to overdo it. Groups are a place for your Facebook community, so it’s essential you find a balance between posting and taking a step back.
5. Avoid direct selling
Most people don’t join Facebook groups for sales content. It’s not a place for shameless self-promotion and upselling products, it’s a platform to engage with members and really add value. While a group exclusive discount is relevant for members, constant direct selling may frustrate members and cause them to leave. No one wants to have a ton of spammy messages filling their newsfeed or sales promotions after joining a Facebook group.
6. Optimize content for engagement
When it comes to Facebook group for business content, it should be consistent, valuable, and relevant. By listening to your members and solving solutions to problems, you can actively encourage members to engage with you. There are several ways you can optimize content for engagement like:
Going Live on Facebook groups
Creating fun games and rewards
Tagging new members in your welcome message
Running polls and giveaways
Recognizing top contributors
7. Leverage insights and analytics
Facebook is known for offering a ton of insights and Facebook groups are no different. You can track metrics on growth and engagement. From these, you can find out valuable information like the most popular time to post, content that gets the most engagement. Groups with more than 50 members can see real-time stats. You can find out your top contributors and keep track of how your group is growing.
8. Provide value to your members
Providing value is one of the pillars of a great Facebook group. Because groups tend to be private rather than a public Facebook page, the content should go beyond what is readily available. As members can post questions or discussions, they can get personalized feedback from experts that otherwise would be difficult to get. With Facebook groups, there are several ways you can add value to members such as creating live watch parties and offering dedicated support for your customers.
9. Encourage members to connect with each other
By encouraging members to not only engage with you but connect with each other, you can continue to nurture your online community. Your members bonding over your brand is great for business. Not only does it contribute to a friendly environment, but having an active community helps to draw in more members. Make it easy for members to engage with you and each other. Encourage members to introduce themselves and welcome new members to create that feeling of family.
10. Keep the content exclusive
If your members wanted to see the same content that’s available to the public, they would look at your Facebook profile. The reason that customers join Facebook groups in the first place is for the potential to see exclusive content. When you create content for your Facebook group, think about how it serves a particular purpose and keep that content exclusive to the group. Not only does it add value, but it keeps members loyal to your group. They may even recommend your group to their family and friends, allowing you to expand your reach.
11. Find a good balance of engagement
When you post and how often will depend on your membership base, industry, and business. While there are days and times that tend to receive more engagement, it’s important to evaluate your Facebook group insights so that you can make data-driven decisions that will have the most impact. Try to find a good balance of engagement so that you interact with members enough, but at the same time, you leave them to engage with each other. Avoid directly selling products and services, and always think about how you can add value to your Facebook group members.
In summary
As Facebook looks to create more meaningful interactions between customers and businesses, Facebook groups can be a powerful marketing tool. Whether you’re creating a new Facebook group or looking for ways to boost your existing one, driving value remains at the heart of your groups content marketing strategy. While your Facebook page is an important part of your
social media marketing
, groups offer a new way to engage, connect, and grow your customer base.

How quickly can new staff learn the system?
How intuitive is the member experience for booking and account management?
Can managers quickly access the information they need?
Ask for demonstrations using your actual business scenarios, not just polished marketing examples. Many providers offer trial periods where you can test the software in your real environment.
Tip #4: Look for strong customer support
Even the best sports club management software occasionally
needs support
, and the quality of that support can make or break your experience.
Look into:
The onboarding process and data migration support
Training resources for staff at different levels
Support hours and response time guarantees
The provider’s reputation for ongoing assistance
Be sure to read reviews focusing specifically on support quality. A provider that’s responsive and helpful when problems arise will save you countless headaches down the road.

He highlights key learnings and actionable takeaways to help new fitness businesses succeed. There are multiple options to get financing for your business, and here, Mehdi shares why he opted for the toughest one.
Like any other business,
setting up a gym requires an initial cash input.
Therefore, it is important to plan for a cash runway of at least six months, or until your projected break-even point, on top of your initial setup costs. This will allow you to comfortably operate the business without running out of cash or needing to inject more funds mid-way. Financing a gym starts with your setup costs, which can vary from $10,000 to $1,000,000 depending on the type of business, and you can explore funding options such as taking a bank loan, pitching investors, finding a business partner, or funding it yourself.
When I was growing up, my mother would often say to me, “don’t play with people’s money.” What she meant by this is if you have access to someone else’s money, you cannot be irresponsible with it. This advice has stuck with me ever since I thought up my first business concept, and this is why I am a big believer in self-funding until proof of concept.
Skip ahead to:
Proving your concept
Finding a business partner
1. Proving your concept
Having watched Shark Tank for at least ten years, I learned that most businesses that pitch their ideas without healthy sales figures often end up handing over a significant percentage of their business in exchange for funding. Many of them get no funding at all. When you have not proven your concept, your position in any negotiation for outside investment will be weak. Even if you apply for a bank loan, it will be difficult for someone with no prior experience and no proven business to get financing. The bank may approve your loan, but it could be for an amount that is a lot lower than what you need.
On the other hand, funding your business with personal savings is probably the toughest route, but because it is your own money, you will be frugal and think through all costs and spend only on what really makes sense.
Start with essentials
Make a list of the essential items you need to start your gym and group them into must-haves and nice to have. Based on your financial forecast, you may need to leave out the nice to haves initially. Instead, focus on
three crucial areas
(operations, finances, and retention) to achieve and maintain the profitability of your business.

Carpe Diem started in a small studio that could fit just 20 people, but the small space helped to keep operational costs low so we could focus on customer acquisition. In addition, we kept class offerings streamlined and only opened up new classes when the existing schedule was saturated. At this point, you need to focus on activities that lead to or generate sales. For example, we sold Jiu-Jitsu uniforms because new members needed them to join, and selling uniforms added to our sales figures.
Look for alternative revenue streams
Once your primary operations are up and running, look out for previously unseen opportunities to generate more revenue. For example, if you have an equipment-based gym that is open for members to use in their own time, there could be an opportunity to bring in new members by offering guided classes. I started by focusing only on teaching adult Jiu-Jitsu classes in the evenings. We tested morning and afternoon classes, but reception was mild, so we launched kids’ classes in the late afternoons, with just two classes a week. It was a pleasant surprise when the classes quickly gained traction, and we increased the number of kids’ classes from two to seven days a week. For more examples of additional revenue streams for gyms,
check out this blog post.
2. Finding a business partner
It is not always possible to have savings that you can use, but if you have skills and expertise and lack funds, finding a business partner can bring in some capital. Entrepreneurship can be lonely, so having a partner to consult with and bounce ideas off along the journey can make it more fulfilling. You should find a partner who can help (not hurt) the business; consider what you’re looking for in a partner to best match your business needs. For example, if you’re opening a boxing gym, a partner with expertise in the sector could bring a wealth of knowledge that supports your niche instead of someone with ‘general business’ knowledge. On the other hand, perhaps you’re happy with your expertise in your chosen modality, and someone with a broader experience would be more beneficial to your needs.
Find someone you get along well with and trust
You will be spending a lot of time together, so having a partner you already get along well with will make tasks like communication and problem solving a lot smoother. In addition, having inbuilt trust in each other helps when conflicts arise.
Shares your vision and values
When you and your partner share the same vision, you can work together towards the same goal. Successful partners with the same values tend to agree on standards on what is good and bad. Values guide our actions, judgments, and choices, so partners with aligned values are more likely to make harmonious decisions together.
Complementary skills and traits
One of my favorite quotes from Canadian entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary is, “to create wealth; I needed to pair up with people whose strengths compensated for my weaknesses.” This is a logical point to consider if you lack certain crucial skills in running a gym.
In summary
It was definitely tough to fund the first Carpe Diem location on our own. However, after three years, we stabilized the business and proved our concept. This put us in an excellent position to bring an investor on board for the second branch, even though we were still amid the COVID pandemic.

Not only that, they will help you offer an experience that consumers now expect from a fitness offering in the current moment.
In 2020 fitness apps have never been more critical. As we are all tired of hearing by now, COVID-19 has transformed the fitness industry for the foreseeable future. Consumers need to be able to get fit wherever they are in the world – regardless of if they’re in a brick and mortar studio or not. Your offering, and the
marketing strategies
you use to promote it, need to appeal to this.
According to the World Economic Forum
, which cites a study by customer engagement platform Moenage, fitness app downloads grew by nearly 50% in the first half of 2020. An incredible increase that shows how popular home fitness has become this year and how digital fitness has taken over
With consumers now very familiar with digital technology, you need to start thinking about how you incorporate this into your gym or studio –
both in your online and in-studio offering.
Start looking at some of the most successful on-demand platforms out there and begin taking inspiration from what they are doing for your digital offering.
First, let’s come back to this article’s opening line and look at how fitness apps will improve your member experience.

How Can a Fitness App Improve Member Experience?
6 Fitness Apps That Will Improve Your Member Experience
How Can a Fitness App Improve Member Experience?
First things first. It’s a huge mistake to think that incorporating a few apps into your offering will suddenly be the answer to delivering a great member experience. In reality, you need to have the correct systems, values, vision, and most importantly, attitude to make sure your members are getting the best experience possible. The apps are just tools you can use to help deliver this.
Member experience expert Chris Stevenson couldn’t have put it better when
he joined us on the Fitness Founders Podcast
a few months back; “Fundamentally, you have to have an organization that believes having a great experience is important. You have to hire the right people. You’ve got to create the right culture. Your vision, mission, values, purpose have to be wrapped around creating it, and then you, as the leader, have to lead by example.”
So if you are looking for the answer to delivering a great member experience, go back and check that episode out before continuing.
However, if you feel you lack those essential tools to help you deliver on your vision, using fitness apps can certainly help get to that level. Here are a few reasons why:
Ease of Use
Your main goal should be to help your members achieve their goals. The only work that they should have to do is show up and put 100% effort into their training sessions. Everything that helps them, be it booking and logging into a live-streamed workout or tracking their daily calories, needs to be as uncomplicated as possible.
Whether it be on an Android or Apple phone, most commercially available apps in today’s market are incredibly easy to use. And there is a reason for this – with everyone’s lives being on their phone; the experience needs to be uncomplicated and seamless – this needs to be the same for your members.
Accountability
Accountability is the key differentiator. By this, we mean it’s the critical difference between a member achieving their desired result and not achieving it. Gym Launch owner Alex Hormozi lays this out very clearly in
his value-packed interview
with us, which took place earlier this year.
He makes the excellent point that largely every workout is the same, especially online. What gives you the edge over Beachbody or Kayla Itsines is that you can keep your members accountable to the goals they have set for themselves.
Fitness apps for tracking activity and nutrition are great ways to get members regularly communicating what they are doing. Tracking forces them to think about all aspects of their lifestyle and slowly make habits healthier as they go through your program.
Ownership of the Process
As well as keeping members accountable, tracking apps help members feel in control of their journey and “own” the process of their transformation. By inputting data regularly, they create a big picture of their change and can step back and see the progression of their journey. Like progression pictures, tracking activity can motivate the person to keep improving.
Realistically you are trying to get the person to a stage where they don’t need hands-on help all the time to achieve their goals. Eventually, the member should be able to take ownership of their fitness journey. By getting them into the habit of tracking their progress, you can help them with this.
6 Fitness Apps That Will Improve Your Member Experience
Technology has become integral to the modern fitness experience, and an app can manage every aspect of a person’s journey on their phone. From tracking personal bests to making sure daily macros are hit, fitness apps have become incredibly popular as they can help people get the results they want.
Now that we have looked at a few different ways fitness apps can help improve member experience, let’s look at some existing apps that can do this. We have decided to split this into three categories.
The first category will look at some of the most popular demand workout apps and what lessons you can learn from their success. The second category will look at activity tracking apps. In contrast, the third category will look at nutrition tracking apps. Both of these types of apps could really make a difference when it comes to your member’s fitness journey.
On-Demand Workout Apps to Learn From
Before this year, there had been a steady rise in apps that either live-streamed or host on-demand workouts for consumers. Peloton is probably the one that has broken into mainstream consciousness the most.
Here are two on-demand workout platforms that you can take lessons from for your digital offering.

Sworkit:
With the tagline of “Fitness Made Simple” Sworkit, like Freeletics, doesn’t require you to have a Golds Gym style set up in your garage. The app offers you a range of fitness plans based on time or focused on specific body parts.
The Guardian
reviewed this app recently
and pointed to some great features. Not only can you alter the music, but there is an instructor voiceover that directs you. Sworkit will also send out push notifications to remind you to workout.
Key lesson to learn:
Small touches, like clear voice instructions and synced music, can help bring your online offering to life. Listen to the
recent Glofox Connect talk
on tuning a hybrid fitness business for some great tips and tricks to improve your digital platform.
30 Day Fitness Challenge:
Transformations usually work best when there is a time limit set, which is the idea behind this app. Available for free or on a premium package (still relatively cheap at £1.99 a week), 30 Day Fitness Challenge allows users to choose a specific plan to follow (fat burn, muscle gain, etc) and has over 400 workouts in its library.
As we have written about previously
in this article
, fitness challenges and contests are so important for keeping your members motivated and engaged. This is especially true when your members are working out remotely. Competition can help a person focus on their fitness goals and offer a way to show off their hard work.
Key lesson to learn:
When you are forced to go online due to a lockdown, run online fitness challenges. Like this app, engage with members individually and set out plans based on an area they want to focus on.
Activity Trackers to Keep Members on the Right Path
You may not have realized it but activity trackers have been around since the early 1980s, albeit a professional athletic level – heart rate monitors were available in 1981 for professional athletes. It wasn’t until the early 2000s that fitness and activity trackers became commercially valuable to everyday consumers.
Fitbit is one of the most well-known brands in the space. According to AP, established in 2007, it now has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold over 100 million active devices
.
The brand is now a part and parcel of fitness culture and has paved the way for more and more brands in the space.
Here are two activity trackers that could be an excellent fit for your fitness program:
Polar:
This company has a more extended history than you may think, founded in 1971 in Kempele, Finland. Polar has the distinction of
being the inventor
of the first wireless heart monitor in 1977. The company has gone from strength to strength since and boasts a whole range of trackers and wearable in its product range.
The most interesting and relevant products for you as a fitness business owner are
Polar Club
and
Polar Flow for Coach.
Club uses heart rate monitors in a group fitness setting to showcase your members’ live performance as they work out. The app also adapts to remote workouts. Flow for Coach, meanwhile, allows you to tailor specific plans for your members based on their workout data.
Charity Miles:
One of the most positive things you can do as a fitness business owner is giving back to the community. Not only are you helping a worthwhile cause, but you are giving your members something to aim for that’s bigger than the goal of just getting fit. This is why Charity Miles is such a great app.
It allows you to donate money to the charity of your choice through logging miles while running, walking or cycling. Money can be donated through their corporate sponsorship fund or from friends and family – you can see more about
this in their FAQs
. This app is an excellent tool for
helping organize a charity event
for your gym or studio community.
Nutrition Trackers That Will Keep Members Clean in the Kitchen
We all know from experience that nutrition is an area where many members slip up when they are trying to achieve their goals. It can be hard to stick to a nutrition plan – especially if you aren’t tracking any of it.
That’s why encouraging the use of a nutrition tracking app is so essential in getting your member the results they want. Not only does it allow them to keep track of what they are eating, but it also gives you oversight and makes them accountable. Nutrition tracking apps are also a great way to help members develop good habits.
Here are two apps we recommend:
MyFitnessPal:
Developed by sporting goods manufacturer Under Armour, MyFitnessPal has jumped to the top of the pack regarding nutrition tracking. It allows you to figure out how many calories you need to consume to gain, maintain, or lose weight and track all your consumption and activities. It has an extensive database of food and drink and has a barcode scanner to identify what you are eating.
The best part of this app is that it’s free. (with premium options available) For your members, the best way to use this to calculate a member’s maintenance calories yourself so its as accurate as possible and then use the app only for nutrition tracking – the activity tracker can sometimes lull the user in a false sense of how many calories they have actually burned through exercise
MyPlate:
This nutrition tracking app is similar to MyFitnessPal and has been developed by the non-profit organization Livestrong. The critical difference is that you get more in-depth macronutrient information in the free version of the account than you do with MyFitnessPal,
If you are looking for something a bit different from MyFitnessPal, then consider looking at MyPlate. The free version has loads of great features; all you need for basic nutrition tracking – the key to this is not to overcomplicate the process.
In Summary
The explosion of digital fitness in 2020 has meant there are so many options out there for consumers. As a fitness business owner, it’s easy to see these platforms as rivals to your offering, but you shouldn’t see it this way.
Instead, you need to embrace the technology that can streamline your member’s experience and ultimately get them the results they want. Also, take inspiration from the best on-demand platforms and improve your system and what you offer as a whole.

Good communication can benefit so many areas of your business. Effective communication helps create happy members, which boosts your retention. In the long-term, you need this combination of ingredients to expand and grow.
Whether it’s celebrating a milestone, updating members on your latest health and safety guidelines, or offering motivation for a member who missed their latest online class, regular contact has significant advantages.

8 Best Member Communication Practices to Increase Retention
Communication and Member Retention
A solid gym member retention strategy is key to a successful fitness business. Experts believe it costs
five times more to attract new members
than to retain your existing ones. If you’re struggling to retain members, it can become an extremely costly issue. When retention and acquisition expert Dr. Paul Bedford joined us on The Fitness Founders podcast, he points out that the relationship you build by communicating with members starts right from the beginning:
Although multiple factors come into play that affects your member retention, communication is a major contributor. If your communication plan is missing the mark, you will find that you have ill-informed members that are struggling to find motivation. Regular contact is part of the relationship-building process.
Communication and member retention go hand-in-hand. Good communication is at the core of a well-operated fitness business. You need a strong communication plan to nurture happy and motivated members. As you increase member satisfaction,
gym member referrals
are more likely to roll in as well as great reviews.
3 Member Benefits of Effective Communication
Helping members and clients succeed in fitness requires expert fitness knowledge and the ability to communicate and motivate. Communication sets the foundation for the relationship, builds trust, and positions you as the authority in your niche. Here are three benefits of effective communication.
1. Better Member Results
Whether you’re a personal trainer or fitness professional, you sell a solution to a problem. That means that potential customers come to you in the hopes of achieving certain results. Whether it’s weight loss, better muscle definition, or improving overall fitness, your members are more likely to keep renewing their membership when they see results.
Your communication plan gives you the ability to inspire, educate, and motivate your members so that they can hit their fitness goals. Whether it’s checking in with a member who missed their favorite spin class or delivering educational resources on healthy eating, effective communication drives member results.
2. Boost Member Retention
A major benefit of good communication is how it affects member retention. Your retention strategy is essential for growing your business effectively. Without retention, you will be spending a lot more money to attract new clients rather than retain your current ones.
Regular contact, staying in touch, and personalized communication help to increase member retention. Your communication strategy should aim to provide your members with everything they need to achieve results and stay fit and healthy. Happy members continue to see value in your offering, even when your competition has a similar service. They stick with you.
3. Increase Member Motivation
Another key part of member retention is motivation. It’s what pushes members to work out, visit the gym, or join a live class stream. Often, when motivation starts to fizzle out, you run the risk of losing a member.
Although a few different factors contribute to member motivation like fresh fitness instructors and a fun workout environment, communication is the foundation for motivation. If you or your employees are unable to motivate members in person, online, or in writing, you will face some issues over time.
4 Communication Skills You Need in the Fitness Business
With a fitness business, you’re trying to help people make a change in their life. Maybe they are seeking a full-body transformation, or they had a health scare and just want to incorporate more movement into their day. Either way, you need the right skills to be an effective communicator in the wellness and fitness industry. Here are four communication skills you need to build trust, strengthen relationships, and motivate members to succeed.
1. Rapport-Building
The ability to build rapport with members is essential. With many gyms closed or running at a restricted capacity, digital fitness is thriving. You still need to be able to build relationships through virtual fitness training as you would in-person.
By showing empathy and understanding, members will be able to speak to your more easily. Being approachable and showing that you care is key to nurturing and building relationships. These types of qualities can come through in both verbal and non-verbal forms of communication.

2. Good Listener
As much as you need to instruct and lead your members, being a good listener is essential in a customer-facing business. If members don’t feel like they are being listened to and their needs aren’t being taken on board, you may find yourself with disgruntled members on the brink of quitting.
Through listening, you can determine the best solution to a problem. Whether it’s offering the right adjustment during a class, or aligning your member with a personal trainer because they need additional help to hit their goals. You should be aware of all feedback and reviews so that you can listen and make any changes to your fitness business before it becomes a problem.
3. Confidence and Clarity
You should be confident and clear to demonstrate your expert knowledge and authority in your niche. Transparency and honesty are key parts of your communication plan. Although it’s important to be confident in all the services and products you offer, you need to remain empathetic and understanding.
Your communication skills and expert knowledge give members the confidence to sign up for your services. This is because they know that they can trust you and you will deliver results. Whether you communicate in-person, on the phone, on your social media channels, or on a live stream, it’s important to maximize your interactions and make the most of every opportunity.
4. Body Language and Non-Verbal Communication
Your communication skills don’t just include the words you use or your tone, body language, and non-verbal communication make up a large part of how you communicate. When you smile with a happy facial expression, you look friendly and approachable. Whereas, a stern face and crossed arms suggest that you don’t want to speak and you may look a bit more intimidating, especially for new members.
The Fitness Founders Podcast has a great episode on
what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur right now
. Eric Malzone, a fitness industry consultant, talks about the key qualities you need to be successful in the industry at the moment.
8 Best Member Communication Practices to Increase Retention
While it’s important to be confident, understanding, and empathetic in your communication, there are certain practices you can follow to elevate your communication strategy. Here are eight best communication practices to increase retention in your fitness business.
1. Personalization and Member Segmentation
Effective communication means delivering the right message to the right person. To do this, it’s beneficial to split your email list and members into segments. Think about the needs they have, interests, demographics, and goals. Whether you’re giving your latest COVID update or showcasing some new fitness classes you think your members will love, personalization is key. By segmenting your members into groups, you can deliver your message more effectively without bothering your customers with irrelevant content.
2. Be Relevant and Relatable
Throughout your communication strategy, the aim should be to stay relevant and relatable. Splitting up your email list and targeting the right people with the right message will help you to achieve this. If you’re sending post-natal workout advice to your general member audience, this may not be relevant for them all. Soon, you will start to see members unsubscribing from your communication and ultimately, questioning how much you listen to their needs.
3. Track and Celebrate Accomplishments
Celebrate yearly milestones and fitness achievements. Keep track of member data so that you can drop members a birthday email or congratulate them on their weight loss. By tracking these types of metrics and keeping an eye on key dates, you can motivate members to hit their goals and show that you care. Something as simple as a happy birthday email and one month’s  access to your digital fitness platform can make a member feel appreciated. You can also take the opportunity to create a personalized workout plan and even upsell your other services.
4. Pick up the Phone
It’s important to use the data you have available to track members. If someone has missed a few training sessions and has stopped interacting with your brand as much, it’s time to step in. Sometimes at an at-risk member has lost their motivation, maybe they are struggling to work out. Pick up the phone for a call or video chat to check in and see how they’re doing. By showing your understanding and caring nature, you can find a solution to the problem and drive even more value. Setting up email automation can help streamline your communication, but adding a personal touch like a phone call or Facebook message can make your communication more effective.
5. Utilize Facebook Groups
Facebook groups can be an effective way to not only speak with your community but can really help grow your business. Often, Facebook groups are much more engaged and can develop into a micro-community. Groups are a great place to share content, videos, answer questions, give insights, and offer support to your members. Your members can use it as a place to speak to an expert in your niche as well as be involved in your fitness community. If you’re using Facebook groups to communicate with members, it needs to be completely genuine and transparent. It’s not about self-promotion, but building a reputation as an authority figure.
6. Use Technology and Social Media
Use tools and technology to streamline your communication. Social media, gym member management software, email automation, SMS text messaging tools all help to make your communication more effective. The right gym management software should include communication features, social media integration, and offer insights. To manage your business effectively, you need real-time information so you can make data-driven decisions. What tools, methods, and technology you use for communication will depend on your members.
7. Ask For Feedback
To find out what your members think, ask for feedback. They will quickly tell you if you’re sending too many or too few emails, messages, and notifications. You can also let members set the frequency they would like to receive emails. Regularly ask for feedback to find out how you can improve your customer service and communication strategy. If members feel like they are up-to-date with your latest news and COVID-secure guidelines, they will feel more confident returning to the gym and getting back to classes.
8. Determine the Best Communication Channels
As competition continues to grow in the fitness industry, you need to speak to your members in the most relevant and appropriate way. That means using the right communication channels. When your communication is well-received, relevant, thoughtful, and sent on the best platform, the more likely the recipient will take action. For example, when announcing your new referral program, you’re looking to provoke action so that a member refers your business. When using the right communication channel and staying relevant to your target audience, your communication is more likely to be successful.
In Summary
Gym’s need to lean on data and technology to create the kind of personalized communication strategy that your members will respond to. As opportunities to communicate with members arise, it’s your responsibility to keep the lines of contact open and remain relevant. Ultimately, a strong communication plan motivates members and increases member retention.

The Rise of Wellness Lovers and Fitness Explorers
The emergence of Wellness Lovers and Fitness Explorers marks a significant shift in consumer priorities. Wellness Lovers integrate fitness with overall well-being, seeking balance in physical, mental, and nutritional health. Fitness Explorers, constantly on the lookout for new and engaging fitness experiences, represent the industry’s adventurous spirit. These personas are not just market segments; they are guiding lights toward the future of fitness offerings.
Interestingly, Wellness Lovers are Millennials and older Gen Z’rs. In comparison to other generations, these two groups prioritize their “total wellness” and will seek modalities that support their needs.
What Does This Mean For Fitness Business Owners?
Focus on creating new experiences and a sense of learning or discovery within your fitness business – this is the best way to build an engaged and active community that keeps coming back for more.

The increasing influence of Gen Z in the fitness market is revolutionizing industry norms. These consumers, known for being active, health-conscious, and socially aware, expect more than just traditional gym experiences. They’re seeking innovative, flexible, and value-driven fitness solutions. Their preferences are reshaping the future of fitness offerings, prompting businesses to adapt and meet these changing expectations.
What Does This Mean For Fitness Business Owners?
Look towards the younger generations to boost your growth and revenue. In doing so, make sure your business offers a more holistic approach to fitness, ensuring that you are catering to the mind and body.
Holistic Health is Here to Stay
Holistic health is no longer just about getting fit, it’s a whole way of life. People are focusing on their physical health, mental well-being, eating habits, and social connections – all at the same time.
This means gyms and fitness businesses need to step up their game. They need to offer more personalized experiences that go beyond the treadmill. Create a fitness offering that gives your members a sense of mental wellbeing, inclusion, and community. Without it, they’ll quickly start to move to competitors that do offer that experience.

Section 4: The Great News – Boutique Business is Booming
Fitness Businesses, particularly boutique fitness businesses, are having a record time.
ABC Fitness’s data reveals a significant resurgence in the fitness industry, with check-ins surging by
90% since pre-pandemic levels
– an unprecedented level of growth. This remarkable increase indicates a strong recovery and renewed enthusiasm for in-person fitness experiences, reflecting a broader trend of individuals prioritizing health and wellness post-pandemic.
We are seeing the most active, engaged member base ever, and they are willing to pay more, join more events, and engage more with your community.
If you’re not seeing these changes in your fitness business, then it may be that you need a fitness business platform that can help you engage with this highly motivated customer base.

Despite the broader industry’s positive momentum, there’s a nuanced picture when it comes to membership dynamics within North American gyms. According to
ABC Ignite data
, while there’s been an
8.2% increase in paying membership
accounts compared to the previous year, there has been
a noticeable decline in new memberships
.
This paradox suggests that while existing members are increasingly loyal and possibly upgrading their memberships, there’s a challenge in attracting new members. The data may reflect market saturation, increased competition, or changing consumer preferences, prompting a need for gyms to innovate and adapt their marketing strategies to attract new clients while retaining existing ones.
What Does This Mean For Fitness Business Owners?
You need to double down on your current member base or create a better business offering than your competitors. As we mentioned above, having a stronger platform that focuses on sincerity and community initiatives can significantly help with attracting new members.

5%
. With all other facility types seeing either marginal growth or no change at all, this is major news for the smaller fitness businesses out there.
If you’re a boutique fitness business owner, you are perfectly placed within this industry to see growth this year.
What Does This Mean For Fitness Business Owners?
Focus on creating a strong, committed group of members who feel heard, welcomed, and engaged within your fitness business.
Gen Z (and older generations) are placing a strong focus on holistic fitness, so ensure you are including that in all of your business offerings. Ensure that you are highly present on social media and that you have engaging, automated messaging systems in place to keep your members (and future members) up to date and part of the conversation.
Feel like you’re missing the tools to make the most of this trend?
Let’s Talk
What’s Next for Fitness Businesses in 2024?
Here’s what our data is telling us:
Boutique studios will continue to thrive in the fitness industry.
Holistic fitness practices that include mental health, community initiatives, and wellness will be more popular than ever.
Community-focused group activities, virtual classes, and the invincible pickleball trend are all safe bets for the future.
Gen Z is willing to spend more and engage more, but you will need to provide more as a business.
Overall, we’re seeing technology and community become the core focuses of every sector of the fitness industry. People want to feel like they belong, and they want to feel like their physical efforts are matched with a full feeling of holistic wellness. If you feel like your business isn’t reaching out to your ideal customer in the right way, we’re here to help

Email is not dead
. In fact, a well-crafted fitness newsletter is one of the best ways to market and grow your fitness business!
Health and fitness newsletters are a tool for connection that can help all types and sizes of fitness businesses:
Build relationships with their members
Turn leads into new memberships
and upsell existing ones
Foster community and re-engage lapsed members
According to GetResponse,
email marketing still delivers strong results
. Instead of fighting fickle social media algorithms, enjoy a direct line to your audience. In fact,
32% of Gen Z consumers say they like to receive emails from brands a couple of times a week
.
But what do you write in your emails? Workout tips and member success stories can
help
position your brand as a source of education and motivation.
Class updates and nutrition know-how turn you into a
trusted information source.
With the right strategy, you can craft
emails your members will look forward to opening.
In this post, we’ll explore how to create a newsletter strategy that drives engagement, boosts retention, and supports your goals—helping you make the most of every send.
What Is a Fitness Newsletter & Why It Matters
A fitness newsletter is simply a regular email sent to your members or subscribers. It’s your Gazette, your Daily Mail, your Times…
and it’s completely your own
. In it, you can share insights and tips related to relevant health and wellness topics, updates about your business, and more.
Email newsletters are an essential part of your marketing strategy.
They offer a way to stay connected with your audience outside of your studio and social media channels. They help you build trust, establish authority, and keep your members motivated.
A newsletter can be as simple or as sophisticated as you like. You can include content such as:
Weekly workouts or fitness challenges
Healthy recipes and wellness tips
Success stories from your community
Upcoming classes or events
Exclusive member offers and promotions
Whether you run a boutique
personal training studio
or a
multi-location gym
, the key is email
content that educates, inspires, and drives action.
And remember, a simple health and wellness newsletter sent at the right times can make a
big
impact. Over time, your newsletter will become one of the best tools in your
marketing toolkit.
The Data-Driven Benefits of Fitness Newsletters
Email newsletters still deliver some of
the most impressive ROI in digital marketing.
The fitness industry is no exception. In fact, the health and fitness sector sees an
average open rate of 48.9%, and a click rate of 1.74%
—well above many other industries.
But it’s the
return on investment that stands out.
Omnisend reports that omnichannel email marketing often yields
$36–$40 for every $1 spent.
Some US-based fitness brands report an average ROI of
$68 per dollar.
As if that weren’t enough to convince you, click-to-conversion rates
increased by 27.6% in 2024.
Automated emails—like ABC Glofox’s scheduled class reminders—generate
37% of all email-driven revenue.
As you can see, health and fitness newsletters are a powerful and strategic revenue generator.

Steps to Creating a Newsletter Members Will Open
A successful fitness newsletter
starts with intention and ends with impact.
These 5 key steps will help you create content that your subscribers can’t
wait
to open:
Step #1: Define clear goals, audience & frequency
Start by
identifying what you want to achieve.
Are you looking to
boost class attendance
, promote your services, or position yourself as an expert in a certain area?
Know your audience.
Are they beginners, current members, or personal training clients? This will guide your tone and topics. Then, set a consistent send frequency (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) so your readers know what to expect.
Step #2: Build a solid, branded template
Use a fitness newsletter template that
reflects your brand’s unique style
—colors, logo, and voice. A clean, mobile-friendly layout with clear sections for content makes your newsletter
digestible and easy to scan
. (For instance, it’s easy to create, brand, and schedule mass and/or recurring emails using
ABC Glofox’s
drag-and-drop template editor.)
Step #3: Write compelling subject lines & CTAs
Strong fitness
email subject lines
increase open rates. Use curiosity, urgency, or a clear benefit to pique readers’ interest (e.g., “3 Core Moves to Improve Your Ride”).
Add call-to-actions that encourage clicks
—whether to book a class, read more, or reply. Vary your subject lines and be sure to A/B split test to see what delivers the best results.
Step #4: Measure performance & optimize
Track open rates, click-throughs, and conversions right inside your email platform, eliminating the need for third-party tools. Over time,
test different fitness newsletter topics, send times, or fitness email content ideas
to see what resonates. Use this data to improve your design and strategy.
Follow these steps and your fitness business newsletter will drive engagement, loyalty, and results!

The truth is, the format of your discount matters just as much as the amount. That’s because people process percentages and dollar amounts differently depending on price, timing, and how the offer is framed.
Used well, discounts are more than price cuts; they’re tools to drive sign-ups, bring back inactive members, and fill classes fast. But use the wrong format, and even a good deal can fall flat.

“20% off drop-in passes.”
Dollar-Amount Discounts ($ off):
Subtract a fixed amount, like
“$20 off your first month”
or
“$50 off a training package.”
When to Use % vs. $ Discounts
Both discounts deliver value, but the difference lies in how members perceive them. This is a topic that has been extensively studied, such as the
framing effect
, the
rule of 100
, among other terms.
Q: When to Use Percentage Discounts?
A: Use % Discounts for Lower-Priced Offers
Percentage-based deals are most effective when the product or service is relatively cheap. The percentage feels bigger, even if the dollar savings are small.
Best for
: Drop-in classes, intro offers, merchandise
Why it works
: The discount looks generous without cutting deep into margins
Example
:
“15% off a $30 drop-in = $4.50 savings”
,  which feels substantial but costs you less than offering
“$10 off.”
Q: When to Use Dollar Discounts
A: Use Dollar Discounts for Higher-Priced Offers
Dollar-off discounts shine when the total cost is higher. The savings are concrete, easy to grasp, and more psychologically motivating.
Best for
:
Annual memberships, personal training packages, multi-week programs
Why it works
: People don’t want to do math.
“Save $50”
lands faster than
“Save 16.6%”
on a $300 package
Example
:
“$100 off”
on a premium service feels meaningful, while
“10% off”
might feel vague or underwhelming
How to Pick the Right Discount Type Based on Price, Product, and Positioning
What are you selling?
For fitness marketers, discount framing is strategic.
High-ticket offer: Use
dollar-off
when you need the offer to feel
high-value
Smaller-ticket offers: Use
percentage-off
when you want the offer to
look big
without giving away too much
How much does your offer cost?
Use the
Rule of 100
Under $100: Use
% off
.
Over $100: Use
$ off
.
What’s the message?
Match the format to your positioning
:
Dollar-off discounts
work better when you
emphasize features
— e.g., “Save $50 on a 12-session strength program.”
Percent-off discounts
land better when you
emphasize benefits
— e.g., “Get 20% off and feel stronger, faster.”
How to Alternate % and $ Discounts to Avoid Buyer Delay
If you run the same type of promotion repeatedly, members start to
wait it out
. This is called
buyer delay
, and it kills urgency.
If your studio offers frequent discounts, switching between % and $ creates perceived variety and helps you avoid
promotion fatigue
, even if the actual value doesn’t change.
And here’s how fitness studios and gyms can put this into practice:
Create Time-Limited, Themed Offers
Run a
“15% off class packs”
promo in January or summer, tied to seasonal intake.
Follow up in another busy period (back-to-school, pre-holidays) with
“Save $25 on any membership upgrade.”
Use Promotions for Specific Engagement Goals
Run
% discounts
to encourage trial sign-ups during big intake months.
Use
$ discounts
to bring back lapsed or at-risk members.
Match Format to Product Type
Use % discounts on lower-ticket items like drop-ins or merch to make savings look bigger.
Use $ discounts on higher-ticket items like memberships or training packages to keep value clear and tangible.

Ways to Beat the Summer Slump: A Guide for Gyms and Fitness Studios
3 Common Mistakes to Avoid When Running a Discount Campaign
#1: Using % discounts on large-ticket items:
“12% off a $600 training package”
forces members to do math.
“Save $75”
is faster and more motivating.
#2: Using $ discounts on small items:
“Save $2 on a $25 class”
looks weak compared to
“8% off.”
Small savings framed in dollars often feel underwhelming.
#3: Repeating the same discount type too often:
Running the same “15% off” promo every few months conditions members to wait for it. Alternate formats to keep urgency alive.

Membership churn is a natural part of running a fitness business. It’s a very simple rule, but as long as your monthly member signups are more than your cancellation rates, you’re doing okay (as long as you’re covering your costs).
However, each cancellation is also an opportunity. Every leaving member gives you a window into your business’s blind spots and a chance to create a better, more engaging member experience.
At ABC Glofox, we work with thousands of fitness business owners who face this challenge every day. What separates thriving studios from struggling ones isn’t avoiding cancellations; it’s how they respond to them.
In this article, we’ll break down the seven most common reasons to cancel a gym membership, and show you how to turn those goodbyes into renewed commitments, stronger loyalty, and even new referrals.

Risks of Cancellation and Rewards of Retention
Let’s be real, getting a new member through your doors takes effort and investment. Whether it’s your time, your marketing budget, or the hours you spend on community outreach, that work adds up.
The data backs it up: it costs
up to five times more
to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one.
Retention isn’t just about plugging a leak; it’s about sustaining your studio’s growth. When more members are coming in than going out, your business gains momentum. That’s why understanding member movement (in vs. out) is a key KPI for long-term success.

You can use the ABC Glofox Member Movement Dashboard to track this trend in real time and act before small problems become big ones.

How to Deal With Cancelling Members
Reasons Why Gym Members Quit
Cancellation is rarely spontaneous. Members often think about it for weeks, maybe even months, before making their decision. By understanding their reasons, you can intervene earlier, communicate better, and adapt your offerings to fit their needs.
Try to be preventative rather than reactive: add an anonymous customer comments box in your reception, send out customer surveys, and just chat to members and staff to find out how your business is doing.
However, no matter how hard you work, you will lose members.
Here are the top seven
gym membership cancellation reasons
, with real strategies you can implement today.
Did You Know?
You can automate your analysis of your member cancellation reasons through the ABC Glofox app. Gain key insights, track member behaviors, and even see the lifetime revenue of members to better understand how to retain those high-value customers.
Cancellation Reason #1. Price
What they say:
“It’s too expensive.”
What they mean:
“I’m not getting enough value for what I’m paying.”
Price isn’t always the problem. Perceived value is. When a member doesn’t feel like your studio fits into their budget, it often means they’re not seeing the benefits clearly. Sometimes, you may actually not be charging enough for your service.
Grey Goose
is an excellent business case of this. Make sure you’re selling your business to the right audience; everyone’s cost-of-living budget is different.
But, then again, your prices might just be too high. Do some market research to better understand your ideal price point.
Solutions:
Highlight value at every stage:
From onboarding emails to in-studio signage, remind members what they’re gaining: community, expert coaching, structured progress.
Add low-cost, high-value touchpoints, such as free
consultations, monthly progress check-ins, virtual workshops, or challenges, to make members feel seen and supported.
Offer flexible options:
Class packs, family memberships, student or off-peak pricing can keep members in your ecosystem—even if they need to reduce their spend.

Cancellation Reason #2. Lack of Use
What they say:
“I’m not using it enough.”
What they mean:
“I don’t feel connected.”
Inactive members are often the ones most at risk, and most salvageable. Community is a vital element to fitness businesses. The idea of fitness has changed enormously in recent years, and it’s important that you tie in a wellness and mentality element into your business. Regular meetups, check-ins through in-app messaging or email, and just simple conversations with customers can go a long way.
Solutions:
Automated attendance alerts:
Use ABC Glofox to flag low attendance and trigger re-engagement workflows.
Better onboarding:
Make sure your welcome process includes goal-setting, habit-building, and community introductions.
Proactive outreach:
Personalised emails, calls, or even DMs can go a long way in helping a quiet member feel remembered.

The Complete Community Building Guide
Cancellation Reason #3. Customer Service
What they say:
“I had a bad experience.”
What they mean:
“I don’t feel respected or appreciated.”
Your staff
are
your brand. A single negative interaction can outweigh months of community engagement. Ensure your staff are well-trained and well looked after to ensure they’re as engaged and informed as your members.
If it does happen that something goes wrong and a customer has a valid complaint, ensure you maintain open communication channels. Have a phone number or email available at all times to prevent any member from being left to stew with their problem.
Also, remember that the customer is not always right. Sometimes, it’s best to let the difficult or unengaged ones go and focus on your community members who deserve your time.
Solutions:
Build a team culture:
Weekly meetings, open communication, and shared goals help staff stay aligned with your values.
Celebrate members publicly:
Birthdays, anniversaries, or “100-class” milestones can be automated in ABC Glofox to build a feel-good culture.
Empower your team:
Train staff to handle cancellations with empathy and provide options rather than just saying goodbye or being defensive.
Key Tip
Your staff can’t know how to handle your business goal if you don’t.
Our free business plan template can give you a clear, shareable business plan and manifesto for you and your staff to understand.

Cancellation Reason #4. Class Schedule
What they say:
“The schedule doesn’t work for me.”
What they mean:
“I’m not being prioritised.”
When classes clash with a member’s lifestyle, frustration builds. This is largely an owner-based problem; you need to understand your customers, their schedule, and how to get them in the door as much as possible.
Remember, a class schedule that works for the winter may not be suitable for the summer. Always keep an eye on class trends and attendance rates.
Solutions:
Survey your members:
Ask for preferred times, formats, and instructors.
Review the data:
Use the ABC Glofox Class Performance Report to track what’s working and what’s not.
Test and iterate:
Don’t be afraid to run limited-time trials or pop-up classes to gauge interest.
Did you know?
ABC Glofox can help you track every one of your members and their activity. From favorite classes to signup dates, you can build a holistic understanding of your members and how you can offer them a better experience.
Cancellation Reason #5. Membership Upgrade/Downgrade
What they say:
“I need to cancel.”
What they mean:
“My needs have changed.”
This is a chance to pivot, not part ways. Sometimes, member needs to change, and they need to take a pause from your business or, even better, they want more. Make sure you have membership types that cater to your members’ needs. For example, allow your members to pause or “freeze” memberships to allow them to have the option of coming back.
Solutions:
Get ahead of the problem:
highlight at-risk members and reach out to them before things get too far. Ensure that your membership types are clearly advertised and promoted.
Create flexible tiers:
Offer mid-level plans, bolt-ons, or pay-as-you-go models that fit evolving lifestyles.
Make changes easy:
Use ABC Glofox to allow seamless plan adjustments in-app.
Learn More:
The Customer Engagement Playbook
Cancellation Reason #6. Medical
What they say:
“I’m injured” or “I’m dealing with health issues.”
What they mean:
“I can’t keep up right now.”
Accidents and injuries happen; it’s part of the business. Make sure that when a member leaves for medical reasons, you make it as streamlined as possible. Nobody wants a broken leg and their biggest pain to be cancelling their gym membership. When members are cancelling, make it easy and also offer them alternatives that allow them to pause or freeze their memberships until they’re healed.
If your business fits the description, you could also offer personal training or recovery sessions to allow your leaving members to feel like there are more options and you’re here to help.
Note:
If the injury happened on your premises, make sure you’re prepared. Our insurance guide below can help you stay protected from litigation.
Solutions:
Freeze, don’t cancel:
Use ABC Glofox’s flexible membership tools to offer pauses instead of cancellations.
Adapt programming:
Provide access to recovery or rehab classes, mobility-focused sessions, or online consultations.
Track return timelines:
Use your CRM to flag return dates and automate re-engagement campaigns.

The Complete Guide to Gym Insurance
Cancellation Reason #7. Moved Away
What they say:
“I’m relocating.”
What they mean:
“I love this place, I might be back later.”
This is often out of your control, but that doesn’t mean you can’t stay connected or create a positive exit experience. Make sure the cancellation process is simple but also offers the chance for members to return if they find themselves back in your neck of the woods.
Solutions:
Transition to online access:
Offer digital memberships with recorded classes or coaching through
ABC Trainerize
.
Refer and reward:
Build partnerships with studios in other cities or countries. If a member refers a friend in your area, offer them a bonus or continued digital access.
Keep the door open:
Let them know you’d love to have them back if they return, and automate a check-in email 3–6 months after cancellation.

How to Choose the Right Software for Your Studio
With so many options on the market, choosing the right fitness studio management software can be a heavy lift. We’re here to spot you.
Follow these 4 steps to lighten the load while making a decision:
Step #1: Assess your studio’s needs and size
Start by asking what your biggest pain points are
right now
. Are you losing time on manual scheduling? Do payments slip through the cracks? Having a difficult time tracking attendance or staff shifts?
Also,
consider your size
. Are you
a smaller studio looking for a few core features
, or a large franchise needing more complex solutions? Pick a platform that fits your business today
and
can grow with you tomorrow.

Step #2: Compare pricing and features
Most gym management software providers offer
tiered pricing plans
. Compare what each level includes, and consider the following questions:
Are you paying for features you don’t need?
Is the price worth the time saved?
Are there any hidden fees (e.g., for extra users or support)?
Focus on software that
provides the best overall value
, not just the lowest cost.
Step #3: Look for ease of use and support
If your software is hard to use, it won’t stick
.
A recent study found that eliminating pain points is more crucial for customer loyalty than ever.
Look for a clean, intuitive interface and strong mobile support—for yourself, your staff, and your members.
And don’t overlook customer service.
Does the software offer live chat? Video tutorials? One-on-one onboarding? Good support can make or break your experience, especially during setup.
At ABC Glofox, we pride ourselves on
partnering with you
, making the onboarding and setup process as smooth as possible. Plus,
our support team is available to help
whenever you get stuck.
Step #4: Read reviews and request demos
Don’t be fooled by lofty claims by some software companies. Online reviews and testimonials give you a window into how other fitness studio owners are using different tools in the real-world. Look for feedback from studios like yours—size, type, and business model.
Most providers offer a
free demo
or trial, so take advantage of it. It’s a good use of your time to get a feel for the software before committing.

Common Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing Fitness Studio Management Software
As with every big decision, it’s important to stay focused
. Below, we’ve outlined some common red flags that can pop up when making your final choice. Learn from others and move forward with confidence!
Overpaying for unused features
It’s tempting to choose the software with the most bells and whistles. But if you’re not using advanced features like
CRM tools
or payroll integration, you’re just paying extra for no reason.
Stick to what aligns with your needs, goals, and business model
. Remember, you know your business better than anyone else!
Ignoring member and staff feedback
Your members and instructors will be the best test case for your software
. So you’ll want to make sure it works for them.
Keep your doors open and
encourage feedback
. Ask questions like, Is the app easy to navigate? Do the class reminders work? Is the booking process fast and reliable? Their input is key to a good long-term relationship with the software
Underestimating training and setup time
Even the best studio scheduling software takes time to set up. You’ll need to import member lists, create class schedules, configure billing, and
train staff
.
Although it may be tempting, don’t rush this process
. A smooth setup now prevents headaches later.

The Five Key Fitness Business In 2025
So, without further ado here at the five key fitness business trends:
Trend #1: Diversify Your Revenue Streams
First, the global fitness market is growing. but profitability is still tight. And, while many studios are surviving, fewer are scaling sustainably. In 2025, the studios thriving are those finding creative ways to stack revenue streams beyond memberships .
What’s working now?
Nutrition programs and
smart meal planning
integrations
Branded merchandise and supplements
Online classes
, workshops, and challenges
Facility rental to local groups outside regular hours
Referral programs and
community-based events
The takeaway? This year, don’t just think about reducing expenses, think about building value ladders for your clients. You can do this by giving them
multiple ways to invest
in their health journey with you.

Trend #2: Bring Wellness Into Your Business Plan
Next, the fitness industry has officially moved past being the emphasis on “getting fit.” These day, members want
holistic well-being
: stress management, mental health support, recovery, and even nutritional guidance.
In 2025, successful fitness businesses are weaving wellness into every layer of their offering. That might look like:
Partnering
with local wellness practitioners (massage, therapy, acupuncture)
Adding mindfulness and breathwork into warm-ups or cool-downs
Offering recovery classes, yoga, or meditation alongside HIIT or boxing
Hosting
community wellness
workshops

The Complete Guide to Building a Loyal Community
Now, let’s be clear, your members are looking for balance, not burnout. So give them a space where physical fitness, mental health, and social connection intersect.
Trend #3: Automate and Personalize Your Outreach
Next, sending one-size-fits-all emails is a thing of the past. In 2025, the businesses seeing the highest retention are those using
data-driven personalization
and automation.
What that means in practice:
Using
automation tools
to celebrate milestones (10th class, new PB, birthday shoutouts)
Segmenting members by interests (yoga vs. weight training) and tailoring communication
Prioritizing SMS and in-app push notifications—channels with the highest open rates

Automation doesn’t mean less human. It means more time to focus on building relationships while the system handles the admin.
Trend #4: Get Ready for Gen Z
Gen Z continues to dominate the conversation, but Gen Alpha (born 2010–2024) is next in line—and they’re already shaping expectations. Both groups are digital natives, value inclusivity, and expect seamless tech everywhere.
What matters to them in 2025?
Authentic, transparent brand voices on
social media
Fitness content in snackable, video-first formats
Flexible memberships and
hybrid access
(in-person + digital)
Proof that your business cares about more than profit—community, sustainability, mental health
Even a weekly “behind-the-scenes” reel or class highlight can boost visibility and connection with this audience. And don’t overlook influencer partnerships—they’re still a key growth lever.
Trend #5: Harness AI and Data for Smarter Growth
Next, in 2025, fitness businesses aren’t competing on classes or equipment alone. Instead, they’re competing on insights. AI and data are reshaping how owners make decisions, market their services, and coach their members.
Predictive retention tools
flag members at risk of dropping off before it happens.

FAQs: Fitness Business Trends in 2025
1. Why should I care about fitness trends for 2025?
Because the industry is evolving and staying on
top of trends
helps you adapt your offerings, attract new members, and keep your current ones engaged. Ignoring them means you risk falling behind competitors who are innovating.
2. How do I know which trends are right for my business?
Great question! Not every trend will fit every studio. So start by looking at your members. For example, ask what do they value most? From there, layer in one or two trends (like wellness offerings or automation) that align with
your brand
and capacity.
3. Is investing in AI tools really worth it for small gyms or studios?
Yes. AI isn’t just for big chains. Affordable tools now help smaller operators with retention insights, scheduling, and personalized programming. Even small steps (like
automated
milestone messages) can create big wins.
4. How can I reach Gen Z and Gen Alpha without changing my whole brand?
You don’t need to reinvent everything. Focus on authenticity, flexible membership options, and creating content in
video-first formats
. Even simple behind-the-scenes posts or class highlights go a long way.
5. What’s the easiest trend to start with if I’m overwhelmed?
Habit stacking
through diversified revenue streams. Add one new offer (like a nutrition add-on, recovery class, or branded merchandise). It’s a low-barrier way to increase value for members and test new income streams.
6. How can ABC Glofox help me stay ahead?

Franchising could be your fastest path to expansion, without the capital required to open every location yourself.
But growth through franchising comes with new, very real
operational questions
:
How do you ensure your new location feels just as dialed-in as your flagship?
What happens when a franchisee in another city wants to run a promotion you haven’t approved?
How do you track performance across 15 locations without drowning in spreadsheets and Zoom calls?
Managing a franchise network means staying in control of your brand while empowering independent operators to succeed in their markets.
It’s a balancing act
—and without the right systems, it falls apart fast.
Franchising as a business model isn’t new—
the first franchise was established in 1891
—but it’s more relevant than ever. Today, there are over
831,000 franchise establishments
in the U.S., with a workforce of 8 million people contributing $897 billion in revenues. The
fitness industry accounts for $30.8 billion
of the broader health and wellness market, with franchise brands managing anywhere from a handful to hundreds of locations.
The difference between franchises that thrive and those that struggle?
Understanding how operations work, recognizing common pitfalls before they become problems, and building the right systems from day one.

FAQs – Fitness Franchise Management
What Is a Franchise and How Does It Work in Fitness?
A
fitness franchise
means taking your success and licensing it.
You (the franchisor) let independent operators (franchisees) open locations under your brand name using your proven business system. In return, they pay an initial franchise fee plus ongoing royalties—usually a percentage of revenue.
For fitness brands, franchising means
rapid expansion
without
the massive capital required to own every location yourself. Franchisees bring their own funding, local market knowledge, and entrepreneurial drive. You provide the blueprint.
The key to successful franchise management? Finding the balance between consistency and flexibility. Your brand needs to feel the same at every location—but franchisees also need enough autonomy to adapt to local markets. That’s where
knowing How to manage a franchise
becomes critical.

Why Franchising Is the Ultimate Growth Strategy
Franchising isn’t just about growing faster. It’s about growing smarter. Here are the main reasons fitness brands choose to franchise:
Reason #1 – Lower financial risk and overhead
Your franchisees cover startup costs: real estate, equipment, staffing, and local marketing. The franchise approach helps you
make your gym business more profitable
without overextending resources. As a result, it’s possible to scale to 5, 10, or 20+ locations without taking on massive debt.
Reason #2 – Faster market penetration
Multiple locations can launch simultaneously in different markets. Your franchisees handle local execution while you focus on brand strategy. When you’ve got the right systems in place,
scaling your fitness business
becomes exponentially easier than opening company-owned locations one at a time.

Reason #3 – Motivated local ownership
Franchisees have skin in the game. They’ve invested their own money, so they’re naturally more motivated than hired managers. This
ownership mentality
creates passionate brand ambassadors who are deeply invested in member satisfaction, retention, and growth.
Take

, an adaptive fitness franchise serving individuals with special needs. After proving their concept worked, they partnered with ABC Glofox to support franchise operations management across multiple locations.
Franchisees got a proven playbook, plus the tech infrastructure to deliver consistent member experiences while adapting to their communities.

Reason #4 – Built-in market intelligence
Every franchisee brings
local knowledge
you don’t have at headquarters, such as community preferences, competitive landscape, and cultural nuances. Smart franchisors create feedback loops that turn these insights into system-wide improvements.
For instance,
Spartans Boxing Club
uses their multi-location setup to test different class formats and pricing strategies. What works in one market informs decisions across the network.
“We have an operating system with ABC Glofox that is built alongside our business which allows our franchisees to start, grow, and scale their business,” shares Nazar Musa, Founder of Spartans Boxing Clubs.

Reason #5 – Scalable revenue model
Franchise royalties create
predictable, recurring revenue
that scales with your network’s growth.
Instead of being tied to membership sales at locations you own, franchising generates income from every franchisee’s success. This model is attractive to investors who value the leverage built into franchise systems.
Top Challenges in Managing a Franchise Network
Every franchise faces similar challenges. Understanding these upfront helps you build systems to address them before they become problems.
Maintaining brand consistency and governance
One underperforming location can damage the reputation of your entire brand. One solution is having a
centralized franchise control panel
that sets clear boundaries about what can and cannot be done while giving franchisees flexibility to adapt to the local market.
This includes standardized class templates, approved marketing materials, and pricing guidelines—all designed to help you
unify the member experience
across locations.
Communication across time zones and locations
When franchisees are
spread across multiple states or countries
, simple communication gets complicated. Effective franchise CRM software includes announcement systems, shared resource libraries, group messaging, and training portals—creating connection despite physical distance.
The goal is to build a franchise community where everyone in the network
feels supported and informed
, regardless of their precise location.

In this interview, renowned fitness expert
Fred Hoffman
sat down with us to give his insights into navigating the complexities of modern customer service.
Fred Hoffman is an international fitness expert and consultant based in Paris, France. He is the owner of Fitness Resource Consulting Services.
He is also the author of
Going Global: An Expert’s Guide to Working Abroad in the International Fitness Industry
When it comes to fitness customer service, members are demanding more than ever, and it’s up to you to create the customer experience that ensures that they enjoy every moment of engaging with your business.
Here’s how to adapt to the modern world of fitness business.
Get to the Core of Your Unique Selling Point
“Great customer service is when a company delivers the promise of the brand.”
It really is as simple as that.
You need to look at what you’re trying to sell to your customers and whether that promise is being fulfilled when they step through your front door.
Fred makes the excellent point that the key to this is consistency. From your website to the branding in your locker rooms, it all has to tie together.
Looking for a complete guide to finding your Unique Selling Point?
Find it right here
Action Step:
Take a deep dive into your online platform and your personal brand – do they match the services you provide? If not, you may need a more
solid fitness management platform.
Embrace Cultural Differences
“A U.S.-based company that wants to come into Europe has to realize that they can’t just reproduce the model and just come and act like it’s all going to work”
Fitness businesses have made this mistake time and again. If you’re expanding into a new market, it doesn’t even have to be a different country, it could even just be a different state, you have to understand that your customers are going to behave differently.
As a fitness business owner, you need to embrace these cultural differences. It doesn’t matter if you’re an international corporation or a single-location studio: culture is at the core of what you’re selling.
Take a moment to understand exactly where your business fits in within that cultural buildup. Are you there to offer a community? A place of health and wellness? Or just a really good workout?
All of these have completely different meanings in different regions, and it’s important for you to know how you can be the missing piece of the puzzle for that area.
Action Step:
Take a look at the surrounding culture and community of your location and then tailor your customer experience to it.
Digital Fitness is Not Going Anywhere
“People want to be able to connect with the business any time, any place, on any device.”
Even if you’re not offering online classes or services, your presence online needs to be consistent, constant, and comprehensive.
Having a clean and easy-to-use website and app can easily double your leads. We’ve all been there, wanting to book a class or sign up for a membership, only to find that we need to call someone or, even worse, go to the business to physically sign up.
If it just takes one click of the mouse or a few swipes on their phone, your leads are far, far more likely to convert.
Want Your Own Custom App?
We’ve Got You Covered
Action Step:
Make sure that your online customer experience is seamless. Look at where your signups are coming from and how you can make it easier for your leads and members.
Craft a Customer-Centric Strategy
“You need to listen to your customers. You need to try out things on your own. You can even have mystery shoppers if you want.”
It’s an old saying but if you want to know what your friends really think about you, just pretend to leave the room for a minute and see what they say.
You could be getting stellar upfront feedback from your customers, but they may just not be comfortable enough to give you the honest truth. Set up online and in-person feedback systems to ensure you’re getting all the reviews you need to fine-tune your business to its highest possible potential.
You can even ask a friend (or a mystery shopper if you don’t have any brutally honest friends) to drop into your location to see what their impressions are and where you can improve.
Action Step
: Don’t believe your own hype. Have clear and accessible online and in-person feedback systems to ensure you’re getting all the insight into your business you possibly can.
Give Your Staff the Power
“If employees are happy in a company and they really believe in the brand, they go out of their way to do things even if it’s just part of their job.”
If you go into a fitness studio or gym and the staff are helpful, engaging, and just happy to be there, you’re sure to have a better experience overall.
Having demotivated or frustrated staff is one of the easiest ways of tanking your member retention rates.
Need an in-depth staff retention guide?
Here’s Everything You Need
Action Step:
Make sure your staff are happy to come into work everyday. Otherwise, they’ll find somewhere else to go.
Make It All About The Customer
No, the customer is not always right, but they are the ones that pay your bills.
Fitness customer service is not an easy nut to crack, but these key action points should help you:
Make your brand truly represent your services
Ensure your services fit the culture and community you’re in
Have a stellar online fitness presence
Get clear and unbiased customer feedback
Keep your staff happy and motivated
If you’re missing any of these, taking the action points above or reading some of our guides will help you through the process.

Key Challenges for Mid- and Large-Operators
Strategies to Attract and Retain Gen Z Members
FAQs About Gen Z and Fitness Operators
TL;DR:
Gen Z’s fitness habits have changed the industry. To attract and retain these members, gyms need to rethink their membership models, upgrade their technology, and create experiences that align with Gen Z’s wellness priorities.
What Mid and Large Operators Need to Know About Gen Z Members
Gen Z
is emerging as the most influential demographic in fitness today.
Why? This generation is reported to have
$360 billion in global disposable income
and represents
40% of global consumers
. Their expectations will reshape fitness revenue models, membership structures, and how you engage with members.
Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.
Understanding Gen Z fitness trends will help you future-proof your fitness business
. For instance,
this generation
demands greater flexibility, personalization, and integration with technology in ways that differ fundamentally from previous generations.
Throughout this post, you’ll learn what drives Gen Z’s workout choices, how technology shapes their fitness decisions, as well as specific strategies to attract and keep these valuable members.
Download our FREE eBook “Understanding Gen Z: How to Future-Proof Your Fitness Business” to stay ahead of the curve.
Gen Z Fitness Habits and Expectations
Gen Z gym preferences look different from what you’ve seen before.
When it comes to fitness, this generation values their
independence
, is highly fluent in
digital tools
, and sees working out as part of their
overall health and well-being
.
Multi-location operators need to adapt their business strategy accordingly.
#1 – Preference for hybrid memberships
Gen Z members expect both
in-person and digital workouts
.
Far from being a pandemic holdover, virtual workouts for Gen Z
have become a
permanent expectation
. These members want the flexibility to hit your physical location when it fits their schedule and
stream classes
when they can’t make it in.
The desire for hybrid fitness membership means your business model needs to accommodate both digital and physical touchpoints easily. Members should be able to
book classes
, access
on-demand content
, and track their progress through one integrated platform.

#2 – Greater demand for personalization
Personalized fitness experiences top the list of Gen Z fitness priorities.
Generic workout plans don’t cut it with this generation
.
They’ve grown up with algorithms that know their preferences
, and they expect the same from their gym.
One way to meet this demand is to create a
structured onboarding process
for new members if your gym hasn’t done so already. The process should include
fitness assessments
, goal-setting sessions, and personalized program recommendations.
Gen Z members want to see their data.
Therefore, another way to personalize Gen Z fitness is to integrate technology so members can
track their progress
, receive personalized feedback, and get tailored suggestions that match their goals.
#3 – Importance of community and social connection
While
68% of Gen Z members prefer working out alone
, they still crave community-driven workouts and digital connection.
This reflects how this generation views social interaction
. They want to feel part of something without constant face-to-face engagement.
Fitness communities for Gen Z happen in group chats, on social media, through
shared challenges
, and in digital leaderboards.
To meet Gen Z members where they’re at, consider organizing
social events and challenges
that
encourage interaction among members
. A month-long challenge with a digital leaderboard, for instance, can build just as much community as a group class.

#4 – Focus on mental health and holistic wellness
Mental health
and fitness are inseparable for Gen Z.
According to our recent
Wellness Watch report
, the second main motivating factor for Gen Z to stay active is
to maintain or improve their mental health and stress relief
(17%)—which ranks just as important as weight loss.
It’s true that this generation views fitness as
one dimension of overall wellness
. They’re interested in how exercise impacts
their stress levels
, sleep quality, and mental clarity. Gen Z wellness culture emphasizes balance, recovery, and sustainable fitness practices over punishing workout regimens.
Technology as the Gen Z Fitness Driver
Technology shapes how Gen Z members use your gym, full stop. Let’s explore some of the ways that digital solutions form the foundation of the Gen Z fitness experience.
The role of fitness apps, wearables, and gamification
Gen Z members
expect
fitness technology. It’s no longer optional.
Gen Z and Millennials are the most open to
AI-driven fitness solutions
. They regularly use
fitness apps
, wearables, and virtual personal trainers. They want smart workout suggestions, gamified fitness apps, and data that shows how they’re improving.
In our
Wellness Watch report
, we found that
56% of active consumers use a wearable
like Fitbit, Whoop, or Apple Watch to track their activity. Furthermore, 49% have used
nutrition and meal planning apps
, 61% have used AI-based fitness tracking apps, and 36% have used virtual fitness trainers or workout generators.
Gamification appeals to Gen Z’s competitive side
. Leaderboards, achievement badges, and challenge completions turn routine workouts into more engaging experiences.
📝
Go Deeper
:
How Gamification in Fitness Boosts Motivation and Engagement
How social media influences workout choices
Social media fitness trends drive a significant portion of Gen Z’s workout decisions.
This generation regularly discovers new exercises, fitness challenges, and workout styles through TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. In fact,
they’re more influenced by fitness creators
than by traditional advertising.
Therefore, your gym needs a
social media presence
that
speaks authentically to this audience
. Sharing user-generated content, behind-the-scenes looks at your facilities, and real member success stories resonate better with Gen Z than perfectly polished corporate messaging.
Seamless digital experiences are the baseline
Gen Z expects
frictionless digital engagement
at every touchpoint with your gym. From discovery to booking to
checking in at your facility
, the experience should be
mobile-first
and intuitive.
Your tech stack should include
mobile-first booking and payment systems
, AI-driven personalization for workout recommendations, integration with
wearables
and fitness apps, and on-demand class options.
Any
friction in these digital experiences sends Gen Z members
straight to your competitors
. If your booking system is clunky, or if members can’t connect their wearables, you’re losing members before they walk through your door.

Understanding Gen Z: How to Convert the Next Generation
Key Challenges for Mid- and Large-Operators
Scaling your offerings to appeal to Gen Z can present real obstacles when you have multiple locations. Here are the biggest hurdles you’ll face and what they mean for your operations:
Meeting Gen Z’s demand for flexibility at scale
Gen Z members want
personalization
and
flexibility
. Therefore, you need operational efficiency across dozens or even hundreds of locations.
Traditional membership models
with tight annual contracts don’t appeal to this generation. You’re competing against boutique studios that pivot quickly and digital platforms that offer unlimited flexibility.
Finding the middle ground requires rethinking your membership tiers and
revenue model
.
Balancing traditional memberships with
digital-first habits
Your existing member base might prefer a traditional gym experience while Gen Z demands something different.
Managing multiple membership tiers, digital-only options, and hybrid models across locations
creates complexity
. You need
a platform
that handles various membership structures, tracks engagement across channels, and shows which models work best in which markets.

Retaining Gen Z members in a competitive market
Gen Z switches fitness providers easily.
They’re loyal to experiences, not brands
.
So if a competitor offers better technology or a stronger community, they’ll switch without hesitation. Your gym needs
retention strategies
that promote continuous engagement and regular touchpoints to maintain member loyalty.
Put differently, your gym’s relationship with Gen Z members
can’t end when they walk out after a workout
. The experience needs to continue through your app, social media, and
community offerings
.
Strategies to Attract and Retain Gen Z Members
Understanding these challenges is one thing, but solving them is another. Let’s look at proven strategies for how to adapt your offerings to meet Gen Z where they’re at.
Build in personalized onboarding from day one
First impressions matter. As mentioned above, your gym needs a
comprehensive onboarding process
that includes fitness assessments, goal-setting sessions, and personalized program recommendations.
To keep engagement high, it’s essential to schedule follow-ups at 30, 60, and 90 days to check on member progress. You can use your
member management system
to automate these touchpoints while maintaining a personal touch.

How to Simplify Member Onboarding With ABC Glofox
Use technology to track progress and boost engagement
Gen Z members want to see their data and receive personalized suggestions to help them break through plateaus. Therefore, your gym
needs tech that easily integrates with Gen Z’s favorite wearables
. Engagement jumps when members can see workout data, recovery metrics, and progress in one place.
Another suggestion is to add
AI-powered chatbots
that answer questions 24/7 and
virtual coaching
through your app for at-home workouts.
Organize digital-first social events
Community is a huge driver for Gen Z, which your gym can tap into by organizing low-pressure social events,
fitness challenges
, and group activities—both online and in-person.
Keep in mind that “social” for Gen Z often means digital-first
. A Discord server, WhatsApp chat, or private Instagram group might build more community than an in-person event.
Provide education about holistic wellness
As we’ve seen, Gen Z sees mental health as an essential part of overall wellness.
Your gym can meet this need by providing workshops on stress management, nutrition, and
healthy habits
. You could even partner with local nutritionists, mental health professionals, and wellness coaches to provide your members with holistic support. These offerings position your gym as a
hub for complete wellness
.
Offer flexible membership tiers
Flexibility is key for Gen Z. Your gym can cater to different needs with
multiple membership options
, such as digital-only memberships for budget-conscious students or hybrid memberships for ultimate flexibility. You might even consider pay-as-you-go options for casual users.
The important part is to make sure all options are
easy to understand
and
easy to switch between
. Needless complexity turns Gen Z away fast.
FAQs About Gen Z and Fitness Operators
What are Gen Z fitness trends? Which fitness trends are most popular with Gen Z?
Gen Z fitness trends focus on
flexibility
,
technology
, and
holistic wellness
.
According to our
Wellness Watch report
, Gen Z loves high-intensity interval training, functional resistance training, and virtual on-demand classes. This generation also gravitates toward fitness challenges with gamification, boutique-style experiences with a strong sense of community, and mind-body practices like
yoga
and meditation.
These members prefer
hybrid memberships
that combine in-person and digital workouts. Plus, they expect seamless mobile experiences and integration with their favorite wearable(s). Most importantly, they value
mental health
as much as physical fitness.
Why are so many Gen Zers fit to quit?
Gen Z takes fitness seriously, but in a different way than previous generations.
For instance, they’re more likely to stay active when fitness
aligns with their broader wellness goals
. They want workouts that help manage stress, improve mental clarity, and support their overall health—not just to look good.
The challenge for gyms is that Gen Z won’t stick with a program that
feels generic or disconnected from their personal goals
. They need personalization, a community connection, and
digital tools
that track their progress. When those elements are missing, they’ll quit and find options that better match their needs.
What do Gen Z members want from gyms and fitness clubs?
Gen Z members want hybrid access to both physical facilities and
digital content
. They expect transparent pricing without hidden fees.
They also want a tech-forward experience, a high degree of personalization, and a strong sense of community. Holistic wellness—including mental health and nutrition support—is equally important.
How can gyms use technology to attract Gen Z members?
Start with
mobile-first booking and payment systems
that include options like Venmo and Apple Pay.
Another suggestion is to use
AI-powered personalization
that suggests workouts and tracks progress. It’s also important for your gym to offer
integration with wearable devices
like Fitbit and Apple Watch. Plus, make sure your gym provides
on-demand and virtual classes/live streams
for ultimate flexibility.
The key is that the technology should feel intuitive and enhance the member experience rather than complicate it.
Make Gen Z Fitness Easier with ABC Glofox
Gen Z has created a fundamental shift in fitness
. And their expectations around flexibility, digital solutions, and personalized experiences will only grow stronger as they gain more purchasing power.
Mid- and large-operators can win by implementing hybrid membership models, embracing digital integration, and creating community-focused experiences.

lot
of hats. Between teaching classes, managing staff, and growing your business, the last thing you need is to
juggle multiple software tools
.
Yet that’s exactly what many fitness business owners do
every single day
. They use one system for scheduling, another for payments, a third for member management, and maybe even
a spreadsheet or two
to track everything else.
(Plus it can be a struggle to find a gym CRM that actually
understands
the fitness industry.)
All this switching between platforms doesn’t just waste time—
it creates potential friction points within your business
. Information gets lost between systems. Your team spends valuable hours on admin work instead of building relationships. And your members experience disconnected service that doesn’t truly reflect
what your brand stands for
.
There’s a better way.
ABC Glofox
brings all these essential functions together in one powerful, easy-to-use platform. Let’s explore how this all-in-one solution can transform how you run your fitness business.
TL;DR:
ABC Glofox combines 5 essential gym management tools into one integrated platform—scheduling, payments, member management, CRM/marketing, and analytics—which saves fitness businesses significant time and money while improving the member experience.

What Is a Gym CRM and Why Do You Need One?
First, let’s clarify what a gym CRM actually is.
A gym CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system is specialized software that helps fitness businesses

. Unlike generic CRMs designed for any business, a gym-specific CRM understands the
unique member journey
in the fitness industry.

Convert
more leads into loyal members
Track
every interaction with leads and members
Automate
follow-ups to keep your pipeline moving
Create
consistent
sales processes
across your team
ABC Glofox goes beyond just being a gym CRM
. Our platform integrates lead management with powerful task tracking so your team always knows what to do next. You can easily see who needs follow-up,
which actions your staff have taken
, and how engaged each prospect or member is with your business.
With features like
automated tasks
,
interaction timelines
, and
performance tracking
, ABC Glofox helps you save time while converting more leads into members.

The 5 Tools ABC Glofox Replaces in One Platform
Tired of managing multiple software subscriptions for your fitness business? Here’s how ABC Glofox brings together 5 essential tools into one intuitive platform, saving you time, money, and countless headaches.
#1: Gym class scheduling software
Your
class schedule
is central to your fitness business. But when it lives in its own bubble,
completely separate from the rest of your member data
, you miss valuable opportunities to maximize attendance
and
revenue.
ABC Glofox
makes scheduling simple
with features that work better for everyone:
Complete schedule transparency
across all devices—desktop, tablet, and mobile
Multi-tiered calendar views
that let you see daily, weekly, or monthly schedules at a glance
Real-time updates
that sync instantly across your website and
mobile app
Waitlist and auto-fill capabilities
that keep your classes full even when cancellations happen
These scheduling tools do more than just organize your calendar. They actively boost attendance through
automated booking reminders
, reduce no-shows with
waitlist features
, and make booking painless for members.
The result? Fuller classes, happier members, and increased revenue without extra work from your team!

#2: Payment and billing software
Literally
no one
enjoys hounding clients for
overdue payments
. Yet many gym owners spend hours following up on failed payments, reconciling accounts, and manually updating financial records across different systems.
ABC Glofox simplifies your financial operations with:
Global payment processing
that works wherever your gym operates
Multiple payment methods
(credit cards, debit cards, and direct debits)
Automated payment reminders
for failed or overdue payments
Real-time transaction monitoring
in an easy-to-understand dashboard
Everything becomes clearer when your payment software
connects directly to your member profiles and class bookings
. You can see who’s paid, who hasn’t, and exactly how your business is performing financially—all in one place.
This integration means less time chasing payments and more time focusing on creating top notch fitness experiences for your members.

#4: Gym CRM and marketing software
Marketing your fitness business and nurturing leads shouldn’t require
exporting lists between systems
or

through:
Website lead capture forms
that funnel directly into your system
Powerful email tools
with drag-and-drop editing and
pre-built templates
Automated messaging sequences
triggered by member behavior
Push notifications
that keep your brand front-of-mind
These tools
make marketing easier
and
more effective
. Because when your system knows
exactly
who’s attending classes, which leads have visited your gym, and
who might be at risk of leaving
, you can send the right message to the right person at exactly the right time.
The result is higher conversion rates and better member retention—all without juggling multiple software tools.

Recent statistics show
that email is now one of the best ways to nurture new leads and keep your members aligned with your business and brand. People are getting tired of the poor quality of many Google search results and web pages, leading them to look for more curated, high-quality corners of the internet. Your email outreach and even newsletters can be that for your members.
Email open rates have increased by more than
100%
since 2011 and 60% of emails are now opened on mobile devices. The push notifications alerts on mobile have clearly boosted the performance of email.
Why this topic matters:
Regular, value-driven engagement is vital to retaining your members for longer, and higher retention equals higher recurring revenue. Sending the right message at the right time on the right channel is the only way to do this.

7 retention boosting email templates
What is a Retention Email?
A retention email is typically sent out to members of your fitness studio to keep them engaged with your business. Retention emails are used in combination with SMS and push notifications (if you have an app for your members) in a studio’s overall member engagement strategy.
There are 4 different types of retention email:
Milestones and accomplishments:
These would typically be welcome emails when the member joins, recognizing anniversaries of membership, and congratulations for achieving goals.
Events and challenges:
Communicate any social events coming up as well as fitness challenges for your members to take part in.
Educational content:
Send out recipe ebooks, workout instructional videos, and other important information to help members succeed in their journey.
Prompts and reminders:
An extremely important form of communication. Send out emails to remind members to attend a class they’ve booked or to remind them to book a class. Members who haven’t booked in a while should be a priority with this kind of outreach – they may be in danger of churning.
If this sounds like a lot of work to write out for every member in your gym or studio, that’s because it is: if you do it the old-fashioned way. At ABC Glofox, we’ve built automated outreach functionality as part of our CRM that allows you to send personalized emails and push notifications to all your members and leads. This can save you hours of time, on a weekly basis, allowing you to focus on the more important elements of your business.

What the Experts Say: Dr. Paul Bedford
“We know what response we want. It’s a visit. We want them to visit again.”
Dr. Paul Bedford is one of the leading experts on retention in the fitness industry.
In his interview with us
, he explained how email and maintaining constant contact with your members is vital to keeping your business alive and growing.
You can read the full interview here.
Essentially, there are two results that you want from every email you send: a visit to your location or a membership renewal. If you can manage that, through whatever means, then you’ve succeeded
He covered two ways to manage this:
Map out the member journey:
Make sure that you have a clear messaging cadence for every single member as soon as they sign up with your gym.
You can download our free member onboarding guide to learn more about that.
Send the right message at the right time:
Don’t rely on a pen and paper or a manual solution to create your email outreach.
Use modern tools to save you time
and give a consistent experience to every single one of your members.
Member engagement shouldn’t be a random, scattered approach. Each communication should have a purpose and prompt a desired outcome. If you’re looking for a system that helps you to entirely automate this process, then ABC Glofox is for you.

How Do I Create a Stellar Retention Email?
Retention emails are designed to get a specific response from a member – a visit. But what are the key elements of a retention email? Let’s take a closer look at 5 different areas.
Personalization and automation:
In general, personalized emails are more successful than standard emails. It’s a good idea to personalize your emails based on the needs of your readers. Even just adding their name to the email can have a massive effect. Or, one that many businesses forget, set up an automated email to offer them a free class or discount on their birthday.
Engaging and memorable
: Creating an engaging and memorable email experience starts with a great subject line. When writing emails, think about adding a personal touch, and get to the point. Remember why your members come to you, and not your competition. Not sure what your USP is?
Read our guide
.
Design to attract a response:
Often, when someone opens up an email they scan it quickly. This is where great design is key. If at first glance, the email doesn’t offer value or looks too dense, the reader will quickly close the email and not take any action. Having a great email design helps to capture the attention of the reader and encourage action.
Speak the customer’s language:
One of the best ways to craft an email is to speak your customer’s language. If you want a lasting, positive impact, use words and language that your prospect understands and can relate to. Although you are the expert, potential members come to you for a solution. It’s your job to break down specialist knowledge into language that can motivate and drive member results.
Simple and clear messaging:
If your email resembles a novel, you might struggle to achieve the kind of results you’re looking for in your email campaigns. Keep it simple, and keep your message clear.
Our partners at
ABC Trainerize
have also developed a new sales email generator that could help you create the messaging that can bring your business to the next level.

7 Retention Boosting Email Templates
Whether you’re looking for the best way to welcome a new member or trying to promote your referral program, gym email templates can help you craft a simple yet effective message. Gym email templates are designed for a fitness business and can easily be adapted to your specific niche and audience. Here are seven fitness center email templates to inspire your next email marketing campaign.
1. Welcome Email
The welcome email is one of the most common trigger-based emails. You send this email after a specific action has been performed. Usually, you’ll send this after a new member signs up for your digital fitness membership or has joined your in-person fitness studio. Trigger emails show that your website or service is fully functioning and help guide your new customer through the member journey.
Try this:
Hey [MEMBER FIRST NAME],
Welcome to the [BUSINESS NAME] family!
Thanks for joining us – we’re very excited to have you on board.
You can get started by booking your induction training session [LINK]. You can find our class timetable, opening times, and any updates on our [WEBSITE LINK].
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. You can simply give us a call on [NUMBER] or reply to this email.
We can’t wait to see what you’re going to achieve!
[YOUR NAME]
2. Encourage Member Referrals
A
great referral email
can help grow your business in an organic and relatively inexpensive way. Turn your gym members into brand cheerleaders and encourage referrals by offering the right incentive. Referrals are a vital lead-generation tool, especially for gym owners. You have the power to get more customers through your existing members.
Try this:
Subject Line: Refer Your Friend and Get a Free [OFFER]
Hi [CUSTOMER FIRST NAME]
Congratulations on hitting your latest fitness goal – you’re amazing!
Because you’re such a valued member, we’d like to show you how much we appreciate you.
From [DATE] until [DATE], you can get a free [OFFER] by simply referring your friends and family. All you have to do is encourage a friend to sign up for [CLASS] and use the promo code [CODE].
It’s that simple!
Thanks again for being part of the [BUSINESS NAME] family!
[YOUR NAME]
3. Post-Workout Email
The post-workout email is simple to automate and can help to motivate members. This is a trigger-based email that’s designed to help members feel like they have a sense of accomplishment. After a workout, they get an email that congratulates them on their hard work and makes them feel good about themselves. It also gives members an opportunity to feedback on a class and show you where you have room for improvement.
Don’t have an automated outreach capability?

4. Class Reminder Email
An automated class reminder email can help to reduce cancellations and
increase group class attendance
and the overall member experience at the same time. By sending timely class reminders, it gives members a gentle nudge to stick to their workouts. This holds them accountable and increases motivation simultaneously.
Try this:
Hey [FIRST NAME]
Don’t forget your [CLASS] on [DATE] at [TIME].
We can’t wait to see you there!
If you need to cancel, simply click [LINK].

5. Re-Engaging With an Inactive Member
Email marketing is a great tool for re-engaging inactive customers. You can reach out with offers, valuable content, show readers what they have missed, and reignite motivation to hit their fitness goals. Make sure to personalize all emails and send valuable content that will make an impact. Your win-back email campaign can help with your member attrition rate and boost engagement.

We haven’t seen you in a while!
Since your last visit, we’ve added hundreds of classes to our digital fitness platform.
For a limited time only, we’re giving you an exclusive offer of [OFFER].
Hurry – this offer ends soon!
6. Follow-up Email
The follow-up email is another essential part of your email marketing. You can send this trigger-based email after certain behaviors. For example, you could use this when a customer starts to book and pay for a class and then stops, or has abandoned their basket on your branded merchandise. Either way, the follow-up brings the focus back to the purchase and encourages the user to take action.

Growing a successful fitness studio and now thinking about opening a second location? This is an incredible achievement, but you need to approach gym expansion carefully and implement the lessons learned from your first location.
You’ve done it. After overcoming all the initial obstacles, you’re now running
a successful and profitable fitness business
with an ever-expanding membership base and high retention rates.
Time to open a second location, right?
The answer isn’t that clear cut.
The decision to
open a second location

Why this topic matters:
According to IHRSA, 81% of fitness businesses fail within the first year.
And while there are no clear stats on the success rate of second and third locations, some of the same challenges remain as with opening your first studio location.

Should You Open a Second Location? Signs You’re Ready
Once your existing gym or studio has become a success, the temptation is to open a second location and replicate this success. After all, the most well known fitness brands in the world got to where they are by taking that leap and expanding out from their original studio!
As most fitness business owners will tell you, there are a couple of reasons why the time is right to open a second location. Here are 4 of those reasons:
The first location is a proven success.
Your first location is
making a profit
and you have high retention rates. This proves your concept works and can be applied to a second location.
There is higher demand than you can handle.
If wait lists for your classes are common and your timetable is at full capacity, it may be a sign you need to open a second location to meet demand.
You have new ideas not suited to the first location.
If you have new class ideas and concepts that aren’t possible in your original location, you may need
additional space or a more suitable facility
.
You’re ambitious.
It’s simple—you aren’t satisfied with one location, you want to build a fitness empire! The first step to getting there is
opening a second location
.
In the next part, we’ll share expert advice from a fitness studio owner who has grown a profitable first location and applied those lessons to opening a second location.

Gym Expansion at Scale – A Strategic Guide for Multi-Location Fitness Operators
What the Experts Say: Mehdi Elaichouni, Carpe Diem BJJ
“My first location was kind of a proof of concept. It really gave me the confidence to open a second location.”
Mehdi Elaichouni
is the founder and owner of
Carpe Diem BJJ
. Based in Singapore, Mehdi bought into the Japanese franchise to open his first location and soon followed up with a second studio.
When he joined us on
The Fitness Founders Podcast
, he talked about his journey to becoming a fitness entrepreneur and how he juggles this role with a full-time job at a prominent advertising agency. In particular, Mehdi gave some great insight into the lessons he learned about gym expansion when he opened his second location.
Here are some key points he made:
Use the first location as a proof of concept
. Once Medhi had proven the concept with his first location, he felt confident in opening a second location. He learned from the mistakes of his first studio and applied these lessons to his second location.
Standardization is crucial
. Medhi looked outside the fitness industry to restaurant brands such as Nandos and saw that the key to their success was
a standardized playbook for every location
, which kept the quality of the product and the overall operations at a high level. This framework applies to running multiple fitness studios, too.
Common Mistakes When Opening a Second Location
Gym expansion isn’t a straightforward journey.
While you may have produced a winning formula with
your first location
, new challenges can pop up with your second location. Before we continue, here are a few potential pitfalls to be aware of when considering gym expansion:
Mistake #1 – Stretching your financial resources too thin ❌
A common problem with opening a second location is that your financial resources can be stretched to a breaking point.
As Medhi noted in his interview, you are going to be making a loss in the first year or two of business in your first location.
This could happen in the second location, too
. Make sure you have enough capital to fund your gym expansion.

Mistake #2 – Not having a playbook ❌
Another key point Medhi makes is ensuring
you have a playbook to follow
for both locations.
Document every successful process from start to finish
in your first location so this can be replicated in the second location. You may have to tweak certain things based on the potential new market you’re entering, but don’t dive in without a
proven roadmap written down
.
Mistake #3 – Underestimating the market ❌
While you may have hit on a winning formula with your original location, it doesn’t mean it will automatically work 100% again. This is especially true if you are opening in a new town, city, or state. Do plenty of
market research
as there might be differences in what kind of messaging people respond to.
Mistake #4 – Scaling too fast ❌
Another effect of success with your first location is
the belief that you can build quicker in the second location
as you’ve “done it all before.” However, keep in mind that scaling too fast could lead to mistakes and shortcuts that will ultimately cause issues.
Scale at a similar pace to your first location
and pay attention to every last detail.
Now that you’re aware of common mistakes with opening a second location, let’s go through a step by step guide to opening a second studio space for your fitness business.
A Proven Gym Expansion Guide to Opening a Second Location
Mehdi applied all the lessons he learned from his first location when opening his second Carpe Diem BJJ location. In doing so, he sketched out a guide for every studio owner to follow. We’ve taken some of these insights and mapped out a proven step-by-step guide to gym expansion below.

Do your market research
Before you open a studio or gym,
research the market you are entering
. Even if you are opening a location in the same city, the demographics and competition may be different depending on your specific location or neighborhood. Adapt your concept if necessary to ensure you have the right fit for the market you’re entering.
An example would be if you are entering a more affluent area, you may need to raise the price of your membership to reflect the higher standard of membership this kind of market prefers.

How to Create a Market Analysis For Your Gym
Secure a source of capital
Gym expansion costs money—a lot of money!
As with your first fitness center location, a lot of investment is needed up front to
cover costs such as rent, insurance, wages, and equipment
. The reality is you could be making a loss in the first year or two before turning a profit, so you’ll need a source of capital to keep the business running.

Mehdi was able to fund his first location from his own resources until he turned a profit. For his second location, he secured
investor capital
. This was possible because he was able to clearly demonstrate his ability to run a profitable business in his first location, which made it easier to secure outside investors.
Before you go forward with your gym expansion plans,
make sure you have enough internal and/or external capital to cover all the business costs
before it becomes profitable.
Make sure your insurance and taxes are in order
The thought of doing taxes and insurance forms can send most people to sleep. However, they are the most vital parts of the business to get in order—
especially
before securing outside investment.
In his interview, Medhi explains the three broad types of insurance you may need:
Insurance mandated by your landlord to protect everything on the premises.
Insurance to protect workers and raw materials during any renovation and construction you may do.
Insurance to cover accidents and injuries to staff and members when you’re up and running.
While this example is for Singapore, it will largely be the same in most countries—
check out the rules around insurance in your area
.
Another point, made by the
Small Business Association in the US
, is to check
which taxes you need to pay in your new location
as this may be separate from the taxes you pay in your first location. This will be the case if you set up in a new state.
Start pre-sales early
Pre-selling memberships
is an incredibly important part of setting up any studio—whether  it’s your first location or your last. There are two key reasons for this:
Capital flows into your new location immediately
. Selling memberships early means you’re generating revenue before the doors open. In turn, you’re able to ease the pressure associated with the costs you’ll incur with wages, rent, and other expenses.
Powerful social proof
. If you open the doors and only two people turn up to your first class, your reputation immediately takes a hit. Full classes from day one, however, show that people want what you’re offering and word of mouth will spread. Indeed, social proof is one of the most powerful factors in early growth.
When Mehdi opened his first location, he started pre-selling a month out. He learned from this and
expanded the timeframe to 6 weeks
so he could pre-sell more trials and memberships—in turn generating more pre-opening revenue than he had for his first studio.
Decide who will run the second location
One of the challenges of running more than one studio location is
spreading yourself too thin and burning out
.
As the owner of both locations, you obviously want to oversee everything that happens as the responsibility for the business ultimately lies with you. However, it can be a good idea to step back and
delegate some responsibilities
in the new location.
Consider appointing a
gym manager
, either from within or outside, for your second location. This will ease the management burden on you and will allow you to focus on the overall success of both locations. Give the manager of the second location the same responsibilities you would give yourself while also regularly checking in to give advice and support.

What’s the best way to expand my gym to a second location?
Start by treating your first location as a
proof of concept
.
Once you’ve proven your model works with strong retention and profitability,
document everything that made you successful
—this becomes your playbook for the second location.
Next,
research your new market thoroughly
, even if it’s in the same city. Secure
enough capital
to cover 1-2 years of potential losses, get your insurance and taxes in order, and start pre-selling memberships at least 6+ weeks before opening.
Finally, decide whether you’ll manage both locations or hire a dedicated manager, and invest in
gym management software
that helps you work smarter, not harder at managing multiple locations.
How much does gym expansion cost and how long until it’s profitable?
Expect
significant upfront investment
for rent, equipment, insurance, wages, and marketing.
The reality is you could make a loss for the first 1-2 years before turning a profit—similar to your first location.
That’s why securing adequate capital is crucial, whether from your own resources or outside investors.
Having a proven track record from your first location makes it easier to
secure funding
, as it demonstrates your ability to build a profitable business.

Is franchising better than opening another gym myself?
The answer depends on your goals.
Franchising
offers a proven model, built-in support, and easier financing, but you’ll pay ongoing royalty fees and have less control over operations.
Opening independently
gives you complete control and keeps all profits, but requires you to create your own systems and carries higher risk.
If you’ve already built a successful first location, you have proof your concept works, and opening independently lets you scale your vision on your terms.

Top 10 Essential Gym Features Every Facility Should Offer
The menu of gym features promising to help you attract new members is a mile long. There are more trends flooding the market in this area than there are legging brands!
So which ones actually make a difference?
Based on what we’ve seen work, here are the top 10 features of gyms to aim for:
#1: Community
Research has shown that social connection can help people live
longer, healthier, and happier lives
. It can even
decrease the risk of premature death
. Fitness studios are a powerful platform to connect people through shared goals.
3 ways to build a sense of community at your gym:
Group fitness classes
are a low-pressure way to help
introduce members to one another
.
Progress tracking
(digital leaderboards, 30-day challenges, etc.) checks boxes for accountability and motivation.
Host monthly social events or workshops
to create deeper connections that go beyond the daily sweat.

#2: Value
Value
encompasses so much more than price. Members are more likely to stay if they feel they’re getting
consistent, high-quality experiences
.
Variety
is also key: Community offers one sense of value, for example, but consider tangible rewards as well.
Birthday bonuses, towel service, or referral rewards
are features that leave a lasting impact.
Also, make sure your
pricing
reflects where you sit when it comes to premium services. Are you offering smart gym equipment, personalization, and a modern, technology-forward experience? Your prices should reflect that.
#3: Accessibility
These days,
convenience
matters more than ever
. A central location, ample free parking, and flexible hours—especially 24/7 access via
a gym door access system
—can make all the difference.
The easier your facility fits into your members’ lives, the more likely they are to show up, day after day.
“(People are) expecting to be able to work out online, to be able to work out in-person, to have a community aspect. We really have to rise to the occasion and meet those consumer expectations.” –
Vanessa Severiano
#4: Equipment
Modern, functional, and well-maintained equipment
is a cornerstone of any successful fitness business.
From smart gyms to classic free weights, ensure your equipment is
up-to-date and available
. TRX, stretch bands, plyometrics boxes…the list goes on. Provide diverse equipment to serve a range of workouts and member preferences. Above all, make sure everything is in
excellent working order.
It’s also important to stay on top of
trends
. The global fitness equipment market is
estimated to reach $14.8 billion
by 2028. The market is evolving, and consumers are more educated than ever.
You know your members best; make sure you’re providing the best experience possible.
#5: Classes
Offering a
wide range of classes
adds value and novelty—from
HIIT
to yoga to spin. Include digital options like on-demand or live-streamed sessions to accommodate everyone. Consider dedicated areas for
stretching and recovery
, two of the hottest health and fitness trends.

offers a central platform for class scheduling, payment processing, and member communication.

#7: Polish
Cleanliness and design go a long way in making a strong first impression. Combine
cleanliness
with
good design decisions
to avoid bottlenecks and enhance flow—think a tidy entry way, clean floors, and sanitized equipment.
Also consider
style
: You want to stand out! This could mean a
cute lounge area
or

#8: Education
To many people, a gym is more than a place to burn calories. It’s a center for
learning and self-improvement
.
Yoga studios
are often like spiritual retreat centers for members.
Ask what types of opportunities fit your business:
Would your members appreciate in-house meditation workshops,
personal training
, or nutrition counseling? Think of services that show your commitment to your members’ well-being. What would elevate your members’ engagement while also creating
new revenue streams
?
#9: Amenities
From free WiFi and juice bars to saunas and childcare,
amenities
are another stream of gym features that attract members and
keep them coming back
. The more you can support your members’ wellness goals and day-to-day needs, the more they’ll love you.
#10: Extras
Sometimes it’s the little things that make the biggest impact
. A comfortable lounge area with charging ports can turn a standard visit into a whole vibe. Massage and spa services show that you want your members to leave feeling refreshed. These
above and beyond
gym features send one message loud and clear:
You want your members to thrive.

How to Choose the Right Equipment and Amenities
With so many features of gym design and amenities out there, it’s important to pick and choose based on your unique business. Here’s how:
Know your audience
Are your people hardcore lifters, casual yogis, or busy parents? Their goals and lifestyles will determine which features matter most.
Stay true to your mission
Your mission statement, together with your
unique selling point
, should guide your decisions. If you’re a boutique yoga studio, focus on ambiance, class variety, and yoga studio booking software.

growth goals
, and competition. This will help narrow down which amenities or equipment investments are most strategic.
Gather feedback
Use
surveys
or app-based feedback to ask members what they value most. Your members are the experts on what they want—talk to them!

There are a lot of obstacles to jump over before you can experience success. The first part of starting a gym is creating a unique concept and defining your who and why. The next stage is to figure out how you’re going to finance your business, gym equipment, and growth.
If you need help finding your unique selling point and what makes your business special,
you can find the full guide here.
Employee salaries, fitness equipment, and monthly rental fees all add up quickly. With ongoing and one-off costs to be paid in full, having a financial plan in place to grow from the beginning is very beneficial. In this article, we try to understand the ins and outs of gym financing and the options you have for funding to get your dream business off the ground.

How Much Does it Cost to Open a Gym?
When you’re trying to gauge how much something costs, no doubt this question is one of the first you need to ask. The problem with this is that the answer can be so different depending on your type of business, size, and future growth plans. The number can vary massively. But to give you an idea of what to expect, here are a few different options and the estimated startup costs to open them:
Home gym for personal training clients – starting at $10,000
Modest budget facility – starting at $50,000
Mid-size gyms – between $200,000 and $400,000
Mega-gyms with everything you could ever want – upwards of $1,000,000
These numbers are just looking at startup costs and what you need to invest to get off the ground. You could open a small cycling studio for $50,000, but even with smaller businesses, the costs can spiral. That’s why it’s important to have some financial cushioning so that you can handle any setbacks without derailing the whole business.
The initial cost of opening a gym is expensive, but the reason it can vary so much is that you may not need everything. Alongside one-off costs such as permits, licenses, and qualifications, there are also ongoing costs that you can factor into your budget. Your recurring or ongoing costs include monthly rental fees, employee wages, and gym equipment lease payment plans.

What Gym Financing Options are Available?
When it comes to gym financing, you have a few options available to get your funding. You may want to use one of these or a combination, depending on your business and situation. What works for someone might not work for another. But the first stage of securing any financing is creating a solid business plan of your vision, expertise, experience, and future growth plans. Understand how much you need to borrow and get your calculations correct and ready.
Bank Loan
One way to secure funding is by getting a business loan from the bank. To have a loan pre-approved by the bank or loan provider, you will need to show your business plan, identification documents, and anything else necessary for credit approval. The benefit of a bank loan is that it’s a secure form of financing. The downside is that it can be expensive because of high interest rates.
Personal Savings
If you have funds available, the least expensive way to finance your business is through your personal savings, as you won’t be paying any interest. The problem with this is that it’s a risk to finance your business solely by yourself if you’re not left with any cash after. But if you have access to personal savings, it can be beneficial.
Find a Business Partner
Another way to secure financing is to find a business partner. In this case, you’re looking for a business partner who not only has the ability to finance the business but who you are willing to give some management control to. A business partner isn’t the same as an angel investor who hands over the money and takes a step back. Your business partner should have the right attitude, skills, and business knowledge to help you.
Pitch Investors and Lenders
Using your completed and thorough business plan, you can start talking to potential investors and lenders about gym financing. You can opt for pitching to an angel investor. These types of people are very wealthy and exchange money usually for a portion of equity.
For your pitch to potential investors, you’ll need to demonstrate your knowledge and make your proposition as clear and attractive as possible. Think about your sales and marketing information, and don’t leave anything out. It can be tempting to avoid talking about a default on a credit card three years ago, but a finance company will find out everything. It’s better to be fully upfront about everything from the start.
Invest in a Gym Franchise
One way that you can open a gym is by investing in a
fitness franchise
. With a gym franchise, you buy into an existing business to gain the right to use the trademark, logo, and business plan. Gym franchise costs range massively and because you are opening a business through an established network, you often have access to discounts on gym equipment and other business costs. The upfront
cost of a gym franchise can range between $30,000 and $300,000
. Of course, some brands are less expensive, while other brands, like
Planet Fitness, require a net worth of over $3 million
.
Leasing vs. Buying
When running a gym business, you will have the choice between either buying or leasing. There are usually pros and cons to both, so it pays to do your research. The best decision usually depends on your business and financial situation. It’s also important to remember that you can do a mixture of both leasing and purchasing, maybe buying your own equipment but leasing the location – it depends on your needs and finances.
Leasing gym equipment allows you to update your equipment more regularly without investing in brand-new equipment each time. One of the biggest benefits of leasing gym equipment, apart from the cheaper initial outlay, is that you can switch out equipment every few years. Having the latest gym equipment is definitely a bonus when it comes to customer satisfaction. If you choose the right manufacturer, your ongoing maintenance costs should be relatively low with minimal downtime on the equipment. The downside of leasing is that in the long run, it is more expensive than buying gym equipment outright.

As your building or location is such a huge cost, most businesses tend to lease property. There are pros and cons to leasing a commercial property. Consider your credit score, downpayment, and accessibility to the market. It’s important to explore your options and speak with a professional so that it makes financial sense whether you rent or lease. Your rent will be one of your bigger monthly costs, but you may not have the initial capital to buy a gym location outright.
9 Costs to Consider in Gym Financing
As you secure funding for your gym, there are a lot of elements to consider. Both one-off costs and recurring payments will factor into your financial projections. By having a clear understanding of gym financing, you can be in a strong position going forward to start your own gym business.
1. Fitness Equipment Financing
One of the key things you need to think about is your fitness equipment purchases. The exercise equipment you need will depend on your type of business. As a spin studio, you can kit out your location with state-of-the-art stationary bikes. A boutique fitness center may want a combination of equipment like treadmills and dumbbells to create the optimum workout experience for members to achieve their fitness goals. You will have the choice of buying fitness equipment or gym equipment financing through leasing and paying a recurring fee. As we mentioned, there are pros and cons to each, so it’s important to make the right decision for you and your business.
2. Monthly Payments and Bills
Another cost to consider is your ongoing monthly payments. While it’s hard to say for certain, the majority of businesses don’t make a profit in the first year. This is something to keep in mind as you will need cash flow for your minimum monthly payments. Ongoing payments to think about include:
Utilities including water, energy, electricity, phone, and water
Employee wages
Gym equipment lease
Mortgage or lease payments
Insurance
Marketing
Payment processing fees
Cleaning supplies
3. Legal Fees and Insurance
Your legal fees and insurance will be a combination of one-off and ongoing fees. As you get off the ground, there will be licenses, permits, and legal fees to cover. The precise licenses and permits your business needs will depend on your location. Consider a business license and health and safety permits. When you’re writing contracts and negotiating leases, these will incur legal fees, so this is something to keep in mind. After your initial outgoings, business insurance will be an annual cost to factor into your budget.
4. Location, Gym Decor, and Maintenance
How your gym looks will impact your business. If you are opening a high-end boutique gym with the latest fitness equipment, it has to look the part. Even if you have found your perfect gym location, updating the gym decor and putting your stamp on the place takes time and money. Going forward, maintenance will be an ongoing cost. This will include the cost of hiring as well as any large fees necessary for bigger jobs.
5. Digital Fitness Equipment and Online Security
Nowadays, digital fitness is a key part of running a gym. We’re living in a hybrid world where someone wants to get in a quick workout after work at home but the next day they want to head to the gym in person for their favorite spin class. There’s a need to offer a level of flexibility and convenience for members. To stay ahead of the competition, digital fitness is essential. A massive benefit of taking your gym online and offering digital services is that it generates an additional stream of revenue that is no longer location-dependent. To start streaming, you will have to invest in digital fitness technology and online security for holding and processing global payments.

6. Liquid Capital and Cash Flow Requirements
Depending on your method of funding, there will likely be specific liquid capital and cash flow requirements. This is especially true for gym franchises and small business loan applications where requirements are in place. It’s a good idea to have working capital in place when running your business to help tide you over and cover any expenses that pop up.
7. Sales and Marketing
To attract members, increase your membership base, and ultimately, grow your business, sales and marketing are crucial. This will be an ongoing cost to factor into your gym finances. Sales and marketing activities include anything that you do to attract members and sell. This could include your social media efforts, paid advertising budget, your website, landing pages, and more. It’s down to you how much you invest in your sales and marketing. There are ways to grow your business organically if you are trying to stick to a tight budget. But overall, your business will benefit massively from a sales and marketing budget.
Read More: The Complete Fitness Marketing Guide
8. Gym Member Management Software
Another cost to think about is
gym member management software
. This is the platform where you will manage member payments, employee payroll, class schedules, marketing, and gain financial insights. The software solution includes a separate portal for employees and members, which gives members complete control over their membership. All of this works to improve member acquisition, retention, and streamline your business operations.

9. Employee Hiring Costs
Employees are an essential part of running any business. These are the people that will represent your brand and create a

Build a Personalized Member Experience with a Branded Gym App
Your logo, colors, and social media are all part of your brand. But your members’ full experience of your gym or studio goes well beyond aesthetics and platforms you don’t own.
A
branded gym app

When it comes to motivation, reminders, or inspiring content,
your app should do the heavy lifting.
Imagine a member opening your app and her class schedule pops up right away. Or being able to quickly change her upcoming bookings to fit her week. Or receiving personalized workouts she can do
if she has to miss a class
—all dressed up with
your brand’s look and feel
.
Imagine sending
push notifications
based on activity levels (“You haven’t stretched in awhile!”), offering milestone-based rewards (“One more HIIT class and you’ll hit 100!”) and delivering in-app content (“Recover better with this post-workout snack.”)
Personalization like this
is fun, effective, and makes smart business sense
. It turns your app into a part of your members’ lives, and your business into a true partner in their pursuits.

He highlights key learnings and actionable takeaways to help new fitness businesses succeed. In this article, Mehdi walks us through how he set up his gym operational plan for Carpe Diem.
I’m a marketing guy by trade. But I love and am obsessed with the history and intricacies of business operations across different industries. From my time working in Nandos to watching how Decathlon shaves two seconds off manufacturing time, it’s clear that solid business operations keep companies up and running. Of course, the scale of operations will differ by industry, but its importance never wanes. As a new business owner, smooth operations will help retain customers that you spent a small fortune to acquire.
The scope of operations covers everything that goes on behind the scenes. In a fitness business, that includes:
Managing staff
Facility management
Finance
HR
Scheduling,
Daily administrative tasks
Customer service
To set up business operations for your new fitness studio, you will need logic and some heart.
Skip ahead to:
Define what operational excellence means to your gym
Go through your gym member’s journey
Automate and invest to generate higher returns
Standardize product offerings and internal processes
1. Define what operational excellence means to your gym
It is common for sales and marketing teams to have set objectives. This should also be a common practice for operations, so everyone on the team knows what they are working towards and can plot a path toward a common goal. The need to achieve excellence does not always mean you have to spend the most or be the most luxurious. It just needs to be aligned with your objectives and your customers.
Operational excellence at Carpe Diem means three things:
Placing customers at the heart of everything we do
Strive for the highest possible quality at a reasonable cost
Task and communication efficiency
If you are not sure where to start, take a look at the
nine key elements
for a guide to setting up your own business operations.
2. Go through your gym member’s journey
To determine what type of processes you need to come up with, take a walk in the shoes of new and existing members and go through the physical and digital journeys that they will take. This helps identify the touchpoints they will come across, so you can then figure out which processes need to be developed and how.
As a new member
Think about your acquisition methods: what process will you have in place for selling a gym membership from start to completion? How and where will you communicate with your target market, pre and post-trial follow-ups, pre and post-sale follow-ups, and their physical journey through your gym.

As an existing member
For existing members, focus on how to formalize the feedback process, cross and up-sell, and the promotion of new events and offerings.
Going through your customer journeys will be key in developing
customer service
, which plays a big role in acquiring and retaining members.
3. Automate and invest to generate higher returns
Today’s
On-Demand Economy
has created customers looking for simple, fast, and efficient experiences. Instead of relying on human response time, explore how you can automate or digitize information and processes to cater to customers. For example, when
I started Carpe Diem,
the first two assets I set up were a website and a gym management software. This gives leads access to information at all times and allows Carpe Diem to operate as a fully digital gym, so all transactions go through the gym management app.
As a business owner, you tend to focus on keeping members happy, but it is also essential to maintain a high level of employee (and business owner) satisfaction. Think about how you can help employees complete their tasks in better and more efficient ways, so they can accomplish more as well as spend time on more important tasks. Also, think about how your own management tasks can be more efficient.
Some examples are:
Investing in gym management software to automate tedious administrative work and generate reports on the fly
Train staff on how to communicate effectively to customers and to internal stakeholders
Invest in products and equipment that speed up cleaning
4. Standardize product offerings and internal processes
My biggest nightmare is not having a standardized product because you will not be able to provide customers with a consistent experience, with some good classes and some bad. This will affect your conversion and retention rate. Standardization also helps to improve efficiency and lower costs and allows you to scale your business to generate more profits while keeping costs manageable.
Develop Standard Operating Procedures
Standard operating procedures (SOPs) help maintain quality and compliance for routine or repetitive tasks. You need to identify which processes require SOPs, set a purpose for them, then optimize them as you operate your business. Examples of processes that require SOPs are:
Onboarding new customers
Facility cleaning and maintenance
Inventory checks and reordering
Handling customer requests
Promoting new products or events
Develop a thought process
While SOPs are not suitable for tasks that involve complex decision-making or tasks that need creative solutions, you can develop a thought process that helps guide you and other staff members to come up with proposed solutions.
Some points to consider:
Background information
Was there anything similar that happened in the past
Reference outside of your business
Key stakeholders
Objectives you need to meet
In Summary
The quality of your business operations will determine the success of your business and how quickly you will start generating a profit. So; develop a keen eye for details, revise and optimize processes, and standardize and automate as much as you can. When in doubt, seek out best practices in different industries as a guide.

A tried and tested method for attracting new members is a gym trial. Free and paid gym trials both have advantages and disadvantages. But, how do you not only get customers to sign up for your gym trial but actually keep them coming back after one visit?
Several factors influence the success of your gym trial. Do your visitors get what they expect from you on their first visit? Are you attracting the right kind of customers to your gym trial offer? These are key questions you need to ask yourself. By breaking down the process of using a gym trial, we can begin to understand how you can effectively sign up members in your business. Implementing the right approach for your business is key to a successful gym trial.
In this article we will look at what a gym trial is, factors to consider when using a gym trial and how to use a gym trial successfully.

What is a gym trial?
Paid trial vs free pass
3 factors to consider when creating your gym trial offer
How to use a gym trial to sign up new members
What is a gym trial?
Gym trials or gym passes give potential members access to your services like cardio equipment, sauna, group classes, and personal trainers. This could look like a one-day pass or two-week trial for your digital fitness platform. The primary aim of your gym trial is to show potential members how great your services are and to give them an idea of what they can expect from you if they were to join. Here are some examples of different gym trials from a few well-known brands:
Glo – the online yoga, meditation, and Pilates platform offers a free 7-day pass before charging $18/month.
Blink Fitness – either a one-day free gym trial in one of their locations or a thirty-day free trial for their online fitness platform.
Equinox – the brand offers guest passes to members to invite new customers to try their services. With the online platform Equinox+, members sign up for a monthly subscription but have a seven-day complimentary period where membership only begins after this time.
24 Hour Fitness and LA Fitness – both brands offer a free three-day gym trial.
As you can see, there’s a variation of gym trials between brands. Digital platforms tend to offer longer trial periods than in-person services. While some health clubs offer guest day trial passes as a way to target new customers, others focus on a broader target audience. It’s not unusual to see a week-long gym trial for a fitness streaming platform. But, in general, in-person gym trials tend to last between one to three days with larger fitness brands offering week-long trials.
Paid trial vs free pass
When crafting your gym trial, you will face the decision of whether to offer a paid or free gym trial. This continues to be a hot topic for discussion with pros and cons to each. When it comes to gym trials, there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. Whether you offer a free or paid trial, the important thing is that your
gym experience
needs to wow customers enough to make them stick around beyond the trial.
Many large gym chains offer week-long free trials to potential customers. These trials are great for attracting new people and getting potential customers through the door. It’s a no-string, non-committal opportunity for members to try out your services. While this is great for getting potential customers, there’s a concern that the only reason someone may sign up for it is that it’s free.
It’s also important to think about how your free trial could impact your existing membership base. The last thing you want to do is annoy your clientele with a constant influx of
free gym trials
who never actually commit to full-time membership. While a free trial can be useful, it can also bring customers who are just looking for a deal.
Paid trials tend to use a discounting model. This could look like a two-month special for new members where instead of paying $50/month, they pay $60 for two months. Although you may not gain the same influx of customers as a free gym trial, the ones that do sign up are more likely to be loyal and sign up in the long run.
Because customers are paying for your services from the beginning, they see the value in your services. You don’t have to convince them of your value because they actively made the decision to sign up for a paid or discounted trial. When you think that it takes a lot of time to form new habits, it’s difficult to show your impact in a one-day pass.
3 factors to consider when creating your gym trial offer
The best strategy for your gym trial depends on your business. If you run an affordable gym, then a free trial may be more suitable. Whereas, if you own a high-end and innovative studio, then a free trial may not attract the type of clientele you’re looking for. Here are three factors to consider when crafting your gym trial offer.
Target audience
One of the most important parts of creating your gym trial is thinking about the type of customer you want to target. Is your target audience committed to fitness and wants to see a real difference? Or maybe they are new to the fitness scene and need some extra help to get to the gym. It’s crucial to think about the type of customer who will be committed to joining your gym and working your way backward. Having a good understanding of your target customer will help to create the right gym trial offer.
Business type
Do you own a yoga studio? Maybe you run a boutique fitness studio solely focused on martial arts or a Zumba studio. Another key factor of an effective gym trial is thinking about the type of facility you have. Do you need more members but charge a lower amount? Or perhaps you don’t need a huge influx of members and would rather target a handful of high-paying customers.
Great brands aren’t afraid to charge for a trial, so remember that it can be an effective approach to gym trials. Another element to think about is whether you’re offering a trial for in-person or digital services, as this could play a role in your decision.
Value proposition
Considering that
50% of gym members quit within six months of signing up to a gym
, the way you add value to your members will be crucial for the trial and beyond. Your unique value proposition is what sets you apart from your competitors. It’s your services, your experience, and the way you make an impact. Your value proposition has everything to do with your business from marketing to member retention. When a potential member signs up for a gym trial, think about the value that they expect and if you are meeting those expectations.
How to use a gym trial to sign up new members
Offering a gym trial is just one way to attract new members and encourage customers to connect with your gym or studio. By understanding how you can create the right kind of offer, you can begin to implement an effective enrollment process that benefits both the customer and your business.

1. Create the right gym trial offer
The first step is creating the right gym trial offer. In general, you have to decide on the length of the trial, what services will be available, and whether it’s paid or free. If you have various facilities, then a one-day pass may be suitable to give customers the opportunity to try everything out.
Some brands may benefit from a guest pass for certain fitness classes or personal training sessions. Think about who you are targeting, your type of business, and your true value proposition. From this, you can develop a gym trial offer to target the right clientele.
2. Promote your gym trial
A key part of getting new sign-ups involves promoting your gym trial. Get the word out there. To do this, you have a few options. One way is to use paid ads and social media advertising to target a specific type of person with certain interests and demographics. In addition, you can promote your gym trial more organically in your social media posts, emails, at the end of blogs or videos, and on your website.
Depending on the type of content you have, you can leverage what you have to promote your gym trial to your web traffic. Also, think about how you can spread the word in person to your existing clientele and local residents through guest passes or even a
gym referral program
.
3. Craft a high-converting landing page
If you’re running ads and directing traffic, it’s a good idea to create a specific landing page for your gym trial and to collect contact information, like phone number and email. While 53.3% of web traffic is from mobile, only
half of landing pages are optimized for mobile
. Landing pages make it very clear to the user what the outcome is from a specific action.
Your ad makes a promise and the landing page follows up on that promise by giving the user clear instructions on what to do next. It should be crystal clear what to do and what to expect. We’ve put together a short guide on
surefire ways to improve your landing page conversions
to get you started.
4. Drive traffic to your landing page
Following on from the first point, we’re going to continue talking about specific ways you can drive traffic to your landing page. To drive conversions, sending traffic to your landing page is a crucial first step. Here are some ideas to help you drive more traffic to your landing page:
Partner with micro-influencers
Retargeting ads
Podcast mention
Email marketing
SEO optimize your landing page
Posting in online communities and forums
5. Utilize automatic trigger notifications
It’s easy to sign up for something on a whim and then forget about it. After a person signs up for your gym trial, think about how you can make the processes as simple as possible. Consider using automatic trigger notifications to improve the overall experience. If a customer has booked their first class with you for a trial, send an automated email a few days before.
This email could be explaining what they can expect and anything they need to bring to the class for a more enjoyable experience. Next, send a class reminder either the day before or the day of the workout or cardio session. Then, send a follow-up notification or text message (SMS) to check in after the trial.
5. Track trial progress
If you’re going to the effort of offering a gym trial, think about how you can track progress. For instance, if a customer has signed up for your three-month paid trial, they are likely looking for a result. Tracking trial progress and showing new members results can do wonders to drive value.
6. Follow up after the trial
One way to follow up after the trial is through an automated email. But you also have the option to personalize the follow-up experience. At this stage, a member of your sales team would connect with the customer to see what else they need. Maybe they are on the fence about joining and would benefit from a personalized workout program, or they are not ready to commit at all.
7. Run an A/B test
If you’re not sure which gym trial to offer and have a couple of options, consider an A/B test. So, with your paid ads, you would target the same demographic with two different offers. These offers would drive traffic to the relevant landing page. Your gym trial offer isn’t necessarily set in stone. As your business adapts, you may spot opportunities that are much more attractive to your clientele.
8. Ask for feedback
As with most things, a useful way to elevate your gym trial is to ask for feedback. When you follow up with customers after their trial, use a simple survey to ask for feedback. This is a great way to gain insight, especially when feedback is anonymous. Find out what’s working and where you need to improve by asking a few straightforward questions.
9. Pass gym trial leads to your sales team
Offering a gym trial as a lead magnet is a great way to attract new members. Your gym trial can be a valuable element of your overall sales funnel. Make sure that you pass your gym trial leads onto your sales team so they can continue to either nurture the lead.
10. Finalize your gym trial process
Before launching your gym trial, it’s crucial to finalize the whole process. That means crafting the offer, creating the landing page, and finalizing the process of how a trial sign-up transitions into a loyal and paying member. Gym trials are a useful marketing and sales tool that can attract members and nailing down the process will make sure that leads don’t get left behind.
In summary
Whether you opt for a free seven-day trial of your digital fitness platform or a discounted three-month trial membership package for new members, a gym trial is a powerful tool for growing your gym membership base. By taking into account your target audience, business type, and value proposition, you can begin to understand the type of offer that would benefit your clientele the most. Your gym trial can help to transition potential customers into paying and loyal members.

will reflect the face and value of your business enterprise. If you select the best staff, more and more people will be confident about the fitness services which you offer. As we saw in
The Glofox Ultimate Guide to Opening a Gym
, hiring the best team you can is essential as
better the quality of your team, the more the clients you will get. Click on a section you would like to read in the table of contents below.
Duties of Gym Staff
First must come up with a job description. The best way for you to create a proper job description is to ascertain the various roles you need to fill.
First and foremost, the staff’s basic duty is to communicate with both existing and potential gym patrons. They should be able to give them valid information about the gym; including membership rates, the facilities at the gym and, how to check in and check out.
Moreover, they should always strive to maintain, service and, ensure the proper usage of the gym’s equipment and facilities. Furthermore, they should be skilled in the keeping of records such as membership registers, invoices and, schedules for classes. It’s important they work towards the enforcement of the gym’s policies to enhance a safe working out the environment and, to prevent possible accidents.
Top Traits to Look for in a Candidate
To select the best staff, you must know which traits you should look out for. There are four essential traits which you should consider. As a general rule, the ideal candidate should have a combination of at least three of these traits.
Strong Passion and Dedication to Fitness
Your staff must have a strong passion for and dedication to fitness. You must discern whether the prospective candidate loves to stay fit and whether the aspiring staff member is always on the lookout for ways to keep fit. The general rule here is that they must be fit. N
ever make the mistake of hiring someone who is neither fit nor has a strong passion and dedication for fitness.
Knowledge and Technical Know-How
Of course, a good education may not make a good doctor; but the education is essential in itself. For you to hire the right person you must check whether they are academically certified or not. You will definitely find the best talent if you seek out for individuals who have the requisite academic qualifications.
An effective staff must demonstrate a knack for continuous learning. When people learn continuously, they grow. Don’t make a mistake of hiring those who don’t have a habit of continuous learning. They may end up applying old, degenerated and, useless fitness techniques to your gym patrons.
Good Communication Skills
As ascertained earlier, the most basic duty of your staff members is to communicate regularly with both your current and prospective gym patrons. Therefore, a candidate should have excellent communication skills. Apart from knowing how to communicate well, they should also possess proper listening skills.
Your team will always interact with your gym patrons daily. Some of these patrons may confide in your staff the challenges they are facing
in their journey to better health, wellness and, fitness. This is where proper listening skills come in.
Compassion and Empathy
As discussed earlier, your staff should have a strong passion for and dedication to fitness. However, this passion should be balanced with compassion and empathy.
Each member of your team should relate well with the struggles that, overweight and, unfit people face in their journey to fitness. By connecting to their efforts, they will be able to exercise compassion and empathy towards them. This will increase their productivity, and your patrons will feel comfortable and welcomed.
The Interview Process
To select the right gym staff, you must have an efficient process of interviewing the prospective staff members. Here are some of the steps which you should take before, during and, after the interview;
Before Interviewing
Before interviewing, there are two significant steps which you should consider. These steps include creating a perfect job description and, selecting only the most promising candidates.
To create a perfect job description, you must highlight all the requirements that you need for a specific job type. Make sure that you set out the relevant academic, experience and, professional qualifications. You should also specify the key objectives which the prospective candidate has to fulfill in the job description.
You should select only the most promising candidates. As a general rule, the best candidates will fit all the requirements of the job description. One way of choosing the most promising candidates is by analyzing their track records. You can examine their track records by evaluating their previous job performances.

During the Interview
During the interview, you should take measures to evaluate further the abilities if the potential staff member. You can do this by noticing the potential green and red flags of a prospective staff member. An example of a green flag is when a candidate gives precise details of the failures and successes of his or her previous jobs. On the other hand, an example of a red flag is when a candidate gives vague information about himself or herself and tells unverified stories.
There are specific questions which you should ask during the interview. Some examples of these questions are:
What certifications do you hold that are relevant to this job?
How can you affect a successful fitness training session?
What will you do to enhance the clientele?
What will you do to increase the membership levels of this gym?
How will you create a significant relationship between yourself and the clients of this gym?prompted
After Interviewing
There are two actions which you should take after interviewing a prospective candidate. These actions include consulting their references and, verifying the information which they gave you before and during the interview. If you don’t implement these two actions, you may hire the wrong candidate.
Career Opportunities
It can be a daunting task to hire the right people. However, once you understand the different positions which are required in a gym; then your hiring process will be much easier. Here are the key areas to fill on your team:
Management
Sales Manager:
A sales manager will sell your membership plans, therefore increasing your membership levels and your income altogether. One of the critical traits of a sales manager is that he or she must be compassionate. If your sales manager has this trait, he will see the prospective gym members as humans and not as mere dollar signs.
Marketing Manager:
The main role of a marketing manager is to advertise your gym through promotions and campaigns. Therefore, you should select a marketing manager who is creative and enthusiastic; and who can mobilize the growth of your gym’s membership levels.

Maintenance Personnel:

Gym Staff Median Monthly and Annual Wages

strong fitness community
is one of the biggest challenges studio and gym owners face. Attracting new members isn’t enough; lasting success comes from keeping them engaged, connected, and excited to return.
In this article, we’ll share ten essential steps to help you strengthen retention and create a community people are proud to be part of. From understanding member needs and shaping your culture, to sparking participation, empowering ambassadors, and using technology wisely, you’ll find actionable strategies you can put to work right away.
Whether you’re opening your first studio or scaling a multi-site business, this guide gives you the tools to build a supportive, loyal community that grows with you.
Step #1: Understand Your Members Deeply
If you don’t truly know your members, you can’t build a
community
that feels like home. The surface-level view of age, gender, and attendance is no longer enough. You need to go deeper and learn more about their goals, obstacles, and interests both inside and outside your gym.
To do that, you can run short surveys, host Q&A sessions, or simply chat with members after class. Ask:
What motivates them most?
What challenges are they facing?
What formats or extras (nutrition, recovery, mobility) do they wish they had access to?
When you create space for these conversations, you can turn customers or clients into members and participants. Members discuss their pain points, share ideas, and reveal what they want next.
That feedback improves both the community and your business. Their voices can shape new programs, inspire add-on services, and even
fuel your marketing
through authentic testimonials and user-generated content.
Glofox can help you share these surveys, and then add the findings as
Tags
, for example, “Beginner Strength,” “Postpartum,” “Hybrid Member.” This will enable you to create tailored experiences for these groups.

How to Build a Fitness Community With ABC Glofox
Step #2: Define & Express Your Unique Value & Culture
Branding can act as the
spark for a community
by telling a story people want to be part of.
But keeping and growing that
community
requires alignment between the brand narrative and the actual experience members have once they’re inside.
You can “curate” your identity, but you can’t fake it. Studios that lean into real aspects of their story, even if selectively emphasized, hold communities longer because the narrative matches the lived experience.
Make this culture visible everywhere:
In your welcome emails and onboarding flow
In the way coaches engage beginners vs. advanced athletes
In the look, feel, and voice of your
ABC Glofox app
Inclusivity should also be central. Ask yourself: are new members introduced to friendly faces on day one? Do you feature a diverse range of body types, goals, and backgrounds in your content? Communities thrive when people see themselves reflected, not when they feel like outsiders.
When your unique value and culture are consistently expressed and authentically lived, you attract the right members, inspire loyalty among existing ones, and naturally create advocates who extend your reach.

Step #3: Maintain Consistent Communication
Consistent communication scales belonging across the whole community. When members see updates, messages, or stories from others, it reinforces that they’re part of something bigger. Regular touchpoints also spark peer-to-peer interaction — the true marker of community, not just the founder broadcasting to everyone. Silence, on the other hand, signals abandonment.
A steady cadence is what keeps the community alive. That could look like:
Weekly updates
: Highlight new classes, celebrate member milestones
Monthly Q&As
: Livestream with a coach where members can submit questions
Daily prompts
: Quick check-ins (“What was your best set today?”) to spark replies in a group
Even simple, repeated touchpoints compound into loyalty and familiarity. Members start to expect that rhythm and return because the space feels active.
On the
ABC Glofox
platform, you can automate welcome flows for new members, send push notifications to remind veterans of their streaks, and send targeted emails to groups such as “Beginner Strength” or “Yoga Enthusiasts.”
Remember, a single timely message that celebrates progress or nudges someone back after an absence can strengthen retention far more than a dozen generic updates.
Step #4: Host Hybrid & Virtual Social Events
Events create shared memories! They’re powerful when tied to your brand identity and followed up with ongoing touchpoints. But they’ll fall flat when they’re one-off hype, don’t match the vibe, or feel exclusive without reason.
And the good news is you can plan and throw even a
hybrid or virtual event
, blending physical and virtual spaces. For example, you might host an in-studio “Strength Saturday” class while livestreaming it for members training at home, or pair a nutrition workshop at the gym with a Zoom Q&A for those who can’t attend in person.
Even casual formats, such as a virtual coffee chat after a workout or a members-only Facebook group hangout, can extend the sense of connection.
Focus on:
Clear purpose:
Awareness, loyalty, or launch
Integration:
Weaves touchpoints before, during, and after
Connection over scale
: Intimacy beats volume
Impact tracking:
Measures more than attendance
You can
host livestreams on ABC Glofox
, as well as promote them in-app, and tag attendees for tailored follow-ups. When members see that your
community
exists beyond four walls, they’re more likely to stick around because it fits into their life, not the other way around.

Step #5: Encourage Member Participation & User-Generated Content
Communities thrive when members see themselves as contributors, not just consumers. Provide your members with opportunities to share their progress, ideas, and stories, and highlight these contributions so that others feel inspired to join in.
User-generated content
, testimonials, and feedback provide authentic marketing material and can inspire new offers or campaigns. Here are some practical ways to spark participation:
Stories & reposts:
Reshare members’ workout updates or progress wins
Challenges
:
Encourage participants to post results or tag the studio
Social media takeovers
:
Let a member share “a day in their life” on Instagram Stories
Member spotlights
: Feature success stories in your Glofox app,
newsletter
, or social channels
There’s another side to this story, too! In communities, members share their problems and what they want next with one another. These peer-to-peer exchanges might reduce support costs, as members help each other before questions reach your team.

, use
Tags
, and

to prompt sharing. Over time, these contributions create a cycle of visibility, innovation, and a sense of belonging.

Step #6: Build Brand Ambassadors & Advocacy Programs
Every community has their
champions
, the members who show up early, bring friends, and sing your praises online. Turning that natural enthusiasm into a structured advocacy program helps both retention and growth.
Ways to empower ambassadors:
Referral incentives
, discounts, free classes, or exclusive perks for bringing in new members
Recognition
: Highlight ambassadors in your app, on social, or at events
Exclusive roles
: Invite them to help lead challenges, welcome newcomers, or test new offerings first
Advocacy programs don’t just drive referrals. They reinforce culture by showing what “living the brand” looks like in real life. Members see their peers celebrated, feel inspired to engage, and often step into leadership roles themselves.
With
ABC Glofox
, you can tag ambassadors, track referrals, and automate rewards. This creates a win-win loop: your most loyal members feel valued, and your business grows through authentic, word-of-mouth marketing.

Step #7: Leverage Technology & Tools for Engagement
Tech can be a powerful enabler of community when it keeps people connected without adding friction. It expands access, keeps engagement alive, and shows you what’s working. But if scattered across too many platforms, it can create problems.
How Tech Helps in Building a Fitness Community:
Access & scale
: Anyone can join from anywhere (apps, forums, livestreams)
Convenience:
Automation, push notifications, and AI tools keep the community active
Data:
Analytics reveal what members value so you can adapt faster
Where Tech Often Goes Wrong”
Surface over depth:
Relying on likes or quick hacks instead of real interaction
Fragmentation
: Communities are split across multiple platforms
Authenticity gap
: Bots or funnels that feel transactional, not communal
How
ABC Glofox
Helps You Avoid These Traps:
Everything lives in one place
: classes, communication, challenges, and tracking
Notifications
are purposeful nudges
, shoutouts, or reminders that feel supportive, not spammy
Automation handles admin tasks
(reminders, onboarding), while real coaches drive interaction, keeping it authentic
Step #8: Offer Tiered Experiences & Community Segments
Not every member has the same goals, fitness level, or availability. Segmenting your community ensures beginners, intermediates, and advanced members all feel equally seen and no one slips through the cracks.
Examples of Segmentation
:
Beginner groups:
Intro workshops, fundamentals classes, private chat channels
Advanced/VIP groups
: Specialized programming, early access, exclusive events
Interest-based segments
: Runners, yoga enthusiasts, parents, or postnatal groups
Tiered experiences don’t mean exclusion; they mean relevance. When members feel content and events are designed with them in mind, engagement naturally rises.
We’ve mentioned various ways to do this with ABC Glofox throughout this article, including using tags, custom groups, and notifications. However, you need to determine which segments work best for your studio or gym.
Step #9: Create Shared Goals & Challenges
Have you ever set a shared goal across all your memberships? Whether it’s a studio-wide step challenge, a month of consistent attendance, or training together for a 5K, challenges turn individual workouts into collective momentum.
Examples
:
30-day mobility streak
: Track attendance in-app and celebrate completions
Wellness challenge:
Combine nutrition, sleep, and activity goals
Seasonal goal
: Prep for a local race or community event together
Challenges work best when they’re clear, time-bound, and celebrated along the way. They give members a reason to show up, check in, and cheer for each other.
ABC Glofox allows you to set up leaderboards, track progress, send
push notifications
, and spotlight participants. This keeps energy high and ensures the challenge lives both in and outside the studio.
Step #10: Measure Engagement & Iterate
Strong communities don’t run on gut feel alone; they evolve based on data and feedback. Tracking what’s working helps you double down on the right strategies and adjust where energy is fading.
Key metrics to monitor:
Attendance & churn:
Who’s showing up consistently, who’s slipping away
Engagement:
Challenge participation, event turnout,
in-app
activity
Satisfaction
: Net Promoter Score (NPS), surveys, or simple pulse checks
Referrals:
How often members bring in friends
Pair the numbers with conversations. Ask members what they love, what feels missing, and what would encourage them to come back. Communities are never static; they need ongoing tuning.
With ABC Glofox, you can pull reports, segment by member
tags
, and track trends over time. Use those insights to refine your programming, communication, and events, so your community stays fresh and connected.

Final Takeaway
Building a fitness community isn’t a one-off campaign; it’s a cycle of listening, connecting, and improving.
Each of the ten steps works together: knowing your members, expressing your culture, communicating with relevance, hosting events, sparking participation, empowering ambassadors, using tech wisely, segmenting experiences, setting shared goals, and measuring progress.
Pick one or two new strategies to test this month, maybe a simple hybrid event, a member spotlight, or a tiered beginner group.
Over time, these incremental actions accumulate to form stronger bonds, higher retention, and a studio culture that people are proud to belong to.

Influencer Marketing: Authenticity on Repeat
Social media comes with a built-in knack for partnerships—
namely between people and brands
. Influencer marketing is a fancy name for when
everyday people or well-known personalities promote their favorite brands
in a natural way on social media.
It’s often a win-win for both.
Influencers offer high engagement and trust, often for an affordable price tag. (Depending on their level of fame, of course!)
Here’s are five keys to achieving
success with influencer marketing
:
Choose the right fit:
Look for local fitness enthusiasts or members who already live and breathe your brand and its values.
Prioritize authenticity:
Let influencers share their genuine experiences to build trust and credibility (AKA: don’t micro-manage.)
Set clear goals:
Are you aiming for engagement, traffic, or sign-ups? Define success before launching a campaign.
Stay on-brand:
Share your visual and messaging guidelines so all content reflects your
online brand identity
.
Content that goes the distance:
Repurpose influencer posts on your own channels to reinforce social proof.
For best results, make sure all influencer content complements your brand positioning and brand voice and tone.
Remember
: just one collaboration at the right time can skyrocket the visibility of your business.
Reviews and Social Proof: The Power is in Your Hands
If you’ve ever scoured Google Maps while traveling for a restaurant with a 5-star rating, you’ve seen social proof in action.
What others say about your business often carries more weight than what you say about yourself.
These days,
member reviews
(one form of social proof) are intertwined with social media via comments, likes, and messages. Similarly,
testimonials
and
user-generated content
give instant credibility to your brand.
Whether someone is choosing a new gym, personal trainer, or fitness studio, positive reviews can tip the scales
from
curiosity
to
commitment.
Put social proof to work for you by:
Making it easy for members to leave feedback.
Send post-session follow-ups, link to review platforms, and highlight happy member stories on your social media and website.
Repurposing reviews across platforms.
Share a glowing testimonial as an Instagram story or feature it in your welcome email sequence. These moments reinforce trust and show the real people behind your community.
Websites and Apps: Your Brand’s Homebase
Your social media might be where people first discover you, but
your website or app is your brand’s command center
. It’s where your audience goes to
learn more, take action, and (fingers crossed) become paying members
. So how can you make sure it’s doing its job?
Functionality first:
Do you want visitors to book a class? Make it easy for them. You want clear calls to action (“Get Started,” or “Join Now”) and user-friendly navigation. You want a fast, well-organized, and
SEO-optimized site,
helping your brand get discovered and rank higher.
Mobile-friendly:
Most people will find you on their phones, so slow load times or hard-to-navigate pages are a dealbreaker.
Brand alignment:
Your site or app should reinforce your brand design. Keep color schemes, typography, logos, and tone of voice consistent across platforms.
If your goal is to learn how to build an online personal brand, your website or app should be the foundation and destination of
everything
you do branding-wise. Use it to collect leads,
host online classes,
or serve as an information/resource hub. And remember: every other channel should lead here.
Content: A Strategy that Builds Trust
Content— AKA brand storytelling—is how your audience gets to know and trust your business. But it only works if you have a plan. That’s where a strong
content strategy
comes in.
The best fitness brands create content with purpose
. From blog posts and
short-form videos
to reels and emails, every piece of content should speak to your audience in your brand voice and tone.

a trust-building engine
that drives leads to your business.
Automation: Amplify Your Message
If around-the-clock content and always-on messaging sounds like a heavy lift, fear not. You don’t have to run the show all alone,
or even be online to do it.
Automation is your behind-the-scenes team
, working 24/7 to help you deliver more consistent content. Scheduling tools for social media and email help keep the content pipeline full and increase interaction.
Here are some examples of automation used when it comes to online brand marketing:
Branded emails:
Reinforce your brand identity and keep members engaged with
welcome sequences, follow-up emails, and birthday or milestone messages.
Auto-DMs and chatbots:
Embed these on your website or via Instagram to help guide new followers toward booking a class or downloading your app. Make sure they’re friendly, helpful, and on-brand.
Content scheduling:
Tools like Buffer, Later, or
ABC Glofox’s marketing automation tools
help you post consistently without being glued to your screen.
“
Be bold, be really bold. Don’t care what people might think about you talking about certain topics. If you’ve got something to say, say it. And create more than everyone else. If you create more than everyone else, you are already on the path to winning.

Why Does Your Fitness Business Need a Strong Brand Voice?
7 Steps to Create a Brand Voice for Your Fitness Business
What Is a Brand Voice?
Your brand voice encompasses multiple aspects. It’s the personality behind your brand, from the words and language you use to the images you implement alongside your marketing collateral. Your brand voice is the emotion that goes into your brand’s messaging and communication. It’s how you cut through the noise and leave a lasting, positive impression on your audience.
Every time you post on social media, update your website copy, launch a new
Facebook ad
, you’re showcasing your brand voice. Just like you would with your social media strategy or new product launch, your brand voice must be well thought out. Developing a brand voice requires consistency and repetition throughout your business.
A brand voice determines the direction of your brand identity. We explore the topic of brand identity further and talk about what branding is and why it matters. Learn about the steps you need to take to
develop your brand identity for your fitness business
.
Why Does Your Fitness Business Need a Strong Brand Voice?
Often, when people think of brands, they think of the visual identity of the business: the logo, colors, and imagery associated with the brand. But, if you removed the logo from your content, would your audience know it’s you based solely on the voice? Nailing your voice can be tough, but it can benefit your brand in the long-term.
Builds Trust
Consistent branding and messaging create trust. By delivering a consistent message, you’re building trust. Establishing a cohesive voice can help you win over potential customers and land new members. Consumers are more likely to engage and spend more money with brands they trust.
Longevity
Some of the best and most enduring companies have a strong sense of purpose and exceptional brand voice. If you want your fitness business to last, you need to develop its identity and voice. Your messaging and communication should be clear and consistent across the board. Developing brand recognition requires repetition over time. If your personality is constantly changing, how will your customers know who you are?
Drive Brand Awareness
According to
Adweek
, creating a brand voice can help solidify you in the minds of consumers. Without it, you have the potential to fade into the background. Whether you’re funny, quirky, serious, or emotional, your brand’s personality and language goes a long way in driving brand awareness. For some inspiration, check out how these three
fitness brands that stand out on social media
with their unique voice and intelligent marketing strategies.
Consistent Messaging
A strong brand voice needs a consistent message and repetition to be compelling. But, a brand voice also helps you to nail down your messaging and keep it consistent across all mediums. It helps you to not only remain consistent online but enables employees to understand the brand voice as well so that your business has one personality.
A great resource on brand voice is The Simple Marketing Show Podcast. Listen to
episode 42 – how to find your brand voice with Bethany Joy
. Bethany is a brand voice creator with a background in copywriting. She talks about how businesses can create a consistent brand voice and why the language we use is important.
7 Steps to Create a Brand Voice for Your Fitness Business
Maintaining a clear voice right from the beginning is key to developing brand recognition and awareness. When you switch between voices, it could potentially confuse, annoy, or even drive customers away. Here are eight steps to take to start developing your brand voice for your fitness business.
1. Audience Research
When you create anything, research is crucial. Your brand voice is no different. When you communicate with your target audience, you’re using your brand voice. So, what better place to start by researching your target audience. No doubt, you probably already have a good understanding of your audience from previous research. Compile as much data as possible on the different personas at your gym.

Once you have a foundation of information, start looking into how your audience communicates. Listen to how your members communicate with each other; what language do they use? How your members talk about your brand is a good starting point when you’re thinking about your brand personality. Of course, make sure the language and personality you use are natural for your brand.
2. Review Your Mission Statement
Your personality should reflect your purpose, your mission, and your core values. Review your mission statement and values. This will help you to figure out how your brand voice and marketing efforts can connect with your core values and goals. After all, your mission statement says exactly who you are and how your brand can help your audience.
If you don’t have a mission statement or feel like you need to update yours, don’t worry. We’ve pulled together a guide on
how to create an effective mission statement for your gym
. We talk about why your brand needs a mission statement and the elements to consider when building one.
3. Analyze Your Current Messaging and Content
If you already have content you’ve produced, take a look at it. Analyze your current messaging and see if it’s in line with your brand. Review all your content and marketing assets, including your website, blogs, videos, social media posts, and print collateral. Look out for common themes and messaging that you feel meet your core values and goals. At the same time, look out for any inconsistencies. Make a note of areas that could be improved.
During this process, pay particular attention to your best-performing pieces of content. If you have a social media post or blog post that performed really well, you can find out what resonates more with your audience. Why did it perform so well, and how can you apply that same strategy and voice to the rest of your brand?
4. Create an Online Member Survey
Audience surveys are a fantastic way to find out what your customers are actually thinking. If you already have members, create a simple poll asking about your brand. Make the survey quick and easy to fill out. You can choose to leave it anonymous; this way, members will be more likely to give their honest opinion. Include questions like the following:
Describe my brand in three words
Can you recognize my brand easily?
If my brand were a person, describe my personality
Whether it’s for research purposes or you’re looking for member feedback,
gym surveys
are a useful resource. Tools like SurveyMonkey, Google Form, and Survicate make the process very quick. You can use surveys for general feedback from new and existing members, fitness goals, and membership cancellation queries.
5. Outline Your Ideal Brand Voice
You’re now at a stage where you’ve carried out audience research, and you’ve received feedback from your members. In order to figure out what you are, it can help to figure out what you’re not. For example, we’re funny but not sarcastic, or we’re quirky but not silly. Repeat this process until you have three or four sentences that explain more about your brand.
Next, take about four words that describe your brand and create a brand voice chart. The chart should explain how your brand voice should and shouldn’t be used throughout the business. For example, if you’re friendly you might be playful but not too casual. The brand voice chart is a great way to really figure out your voice and nail down the specifics.

. The episode talks about defining your fitness brand, standing out from the competition, and brand consistency.
6. Clear Content and Marketing Guidelines
For your brand voice to be consistent across your business, you need to inform your employees. This means delivering clear content and marketing guidelines that they can refer to when creating any piece of content, posting on social media, or pushing out a new Google Ads campaign.
Guidelines help to ensure consistency across all employees. Whether you’re filming an Instagram Story of your latest fitness challenge or writing a blog post about how to keep your fitness motivation up, guidelines help ensure consistent messaging. It doesn’t matter if you have a team of two or twenty, it’s essential to make sure everyone is on the same page and presenting one brand voice.
7. Be Consistent Across All Channels
Consistency is the key to successful branding. It comes as no surprise that repetition and consistency can make or break a brand. There’s a lot of elements that come into play when we discuss branding from your design and perspective to words and core values.
Once you’ve created your brand voice, ensure that it aligns with the rest of your branding. Ideally, you can create your brand voice as you develop the rest of your brand. But, if this isn’t the case, then just check back to the rest of your branding to make sure your voice fits your business.
In order to create a strong brand voice and benefit from it, it needs to be enforced across all channels. Share your branding documents and guidelines with all employees and make it a part of the onboarding process. All customer-facing assets should sound like they were produced by one brand and one personality.
In Summary
Brand voice is essential for building out your larger brand identity and creating consistent messaging throughout your business. Your brand voice allows you to connect with potential members and build trust. By carrying out thorough research and taking the right steps, you can start to develop your brand voice and drive your fitness brand forward.

What is Fitness Branding?
A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories, and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another.
Seth Godin
A brand is more than a logo, the colors you use, or even your name. Your brand is your customer’s overall perception of your business. It’s your reputation and what people say about your business when you’re not there.
Your fitness branding is a combination of strategy, identity, and fitness marketing. A successful brand is consistent across multiple touchpoints. You can feel it throughout your website, social media, and both your online and in-person workouts. Building a brand requires strategic thinking and planning; it’s about cultivating a positive image while also standing out from the crowd.
It’s a great starting point to think about how you want to be perceived and what you want the world to say about your gym: How do you want the world to see your business? This question will set the foundation for your brand.

Why is Strong Fitness Branding Important to Your Business?
A strong fitness brand requires more than a logo and a color palette. It’s all that and more; it’s your identity. Good branding translates across mediums. By combining skill, creativity, and strategy, you can create a brand that stands out from the competition. Here are four reasons your fitness business needs a strong brand.
#1: Trust
Your branding creates a spark between your business and your customer. Your brand tells your story, creates a connection, and builds trust. This connection and trust build gradually over time; it’s not immediate. Generally, people are more likely to purchase or commit to a product or service from a business that feels polished and legitimate. Your branding can reinforce that trust throughout your business. This keeps pushing the point that you are an authority in your niche, and your customers should trust you.

#2: Recognition
Your logo is a major part of your branding. Often, a logo ends up turning into the face of the company. Eventually, you can recognize a brand based solely on a logo. A well-designed and professional logo is powerful and memorable enough to make an impression. A great logo makes an impression on a customer. The better your brand awareness, the more your potential clients will think of you when they see your logo, messaging, services, and products.
#3: Motivate and Inspire
A great brand does more than attract new clients; it motivates and inspires your employees.  When a business has a great brand, it has a mission and an identity that rallies its employees. Your team understands the reason for the business, and its purpose. This means they can all work towards a common goal in achieving the mission you have set out. A consistent and unified brand helps to create passionate employees. The brand is reinforced in your design and logo and in the daily interactions your members have with your team.

#4: Generate Customers
A strong brand presence helps to generate customers. It solidifies your business in your customer’s minds, making them more likely to refer their friends and family. Successful businesses, small or large, have established themselves as a leader and authority in their niche. A strong brand helps you build that authority that will mean customers will come to you because you are unique and stand out from the competition.

The 5-Step Fitness Branding Framework for Success
Several elements combine to create your fitness branding. Here is our five-step framework for creating an amazing brand to make the process as easy as possible.
#1: Understand Your Target Audience and Member Personas
The first step is to truly understand the inner workings of your target audience. Many gyms and fitness centers have multiple member personas. When you think about your branding, start by considering who your ideal customer will be. One thing that some of the strongest fitness brands have in common is a clear understanding of their target audience. They know exactly who they are speaking to with everything they say.
When you know who you are speaking to, you can develop a brand identity that is fully aligned with your audience. To understand who you want to reach, it’s a good idea to write down your member personas. The personas represent different target segments. You want to find out as much information about these personas as possible so that you can find out what drives them. All this information can influence your brand visuals, personality, and more.
#2: Discover Your Purpose
At this point of your branding process, it’s time to discover why you are different, what makes you unique and why anyone should care. Think about the problem you are solving and your differentiating factors. When two gyms essentially do the same thing, why would a potential member choose one over another? That’s where your branding can have a powerful effect on the decision-making process. Your purpose sets the foundation for your branding. Elements such as your tagline, slogan, voice, tone, messaging, mission statement and more all arise from your very purpose for existing.
#3: Do Your Market Research
In the early stages of your fitness brand, a lot of the decisions will come off the back of thorough research. Do your market research and find out what competitor brands are doing. Look at where your competition succeeds and fails. By analyzing your competitive landscape, you can unearth opportunities that will help you create both an incredible brand as well as form the basis of a killer strategy. When you find a gap in the market, you can figure out what makes you different and stand out from the competition. The goal is to set your business apart, not to emulate a brand exactly that is already successful.

#4: Design Your Visual Fitness Branding
A strong and recognized brand makes a visual impact. It’s memorable, cohesive, and is easy to apply to multiple design elements. Your brand visuals are the embodiment of your purpose, mission, and values. It’s what your customers will see on your website, marketing materials, staff t-shirts, fitness clothing, and anything else you put your business name on. When designing your brand visuals, there are a few factors to consider including:
Logo
Color
Typography
Imagery styles
Branding guide
#5: Establish and Live Your Brand
When you combine all these elements, you create and establish your brand. A brand is visual, emotional, and human. It’s hugely valuable. It’s crucial that you maintain brand consistency across all parts of your business. When switching between your social media, website, and digital fitness platform, there should be no question about who you are and what you represent. After establishing your brand, you and your employees need to implement and live the brand. If you’re all about fun, inclusivity, and vibrancy, your members should feel this in everything from a social media post to your latest class stream.
In Summary
There is a lot more to building a brand than designing a logo and choosing a complementary colorway. While it may seem intimidating to build a successful fitness brand, you can move through the process much more effectively with the right guidance. Your brand helps you to connect with customers, build trust, and ultimately grow your business. Building a brand requires a framework and strategy. By taking the steps necessary, you can work to develop a memorable brand that will become one of your most valuable business assets.

It’s a broad position, ranging anywhere from the company manager to director of the fitness facility. Either way, this person has an important job – to oversee the overall operation and forward movement of a fitness center. Let’s delve into the details and see what’s needed to do this job effectively
What Is A Gym Manager?
A manager or director of a gym can wear many hats, and often does multiple different jobs within a fitness facility. With all the roles that are necessary to fill to ensure that a gym runs smoothly, making sure this person fits successfully into their job is essential to the overall business. There are many
responsibilities
for a successful gym manager on a day to day basis; let’s look at a handful of them now!
Business Manager
: This administrative duty is one of the foundations of a strong leader; running a fitness center can be quite difficult if someone didn’t hire employees, set schedules, and manage payroll. Granted, an HR professional could most certainly be hired to do this – but to get things up and off the ground, special attention must be made in this area to manage expenses and the training/certification processes of current and future employees to be successful. Breaking down the expenses of the gym each month, along with developing business plans for buying equipment and membership fees, are just a few of the administrative duties of a gym manager.
Customer Service:
being in the position of the face of the company, a gym manager is essentially the leader and example for exemplary customer service. The satisfaction of every member who decides to join (and ultimately, even the ones that don’t) is the responsibility of the manager, and those values then instilled on corresponding co-workers and team members. This push on customer service can be driven through ideas for promotional classes, free workouts, and discounts or bonuses for members, just to name a few.
Equipment and Facilities Manager:
not only does this particular duty include ordering equipment and sporting goods that are used daily within the gym, but it also includes developing a cleaning and maintenance schedule to ensure all pieces and parts are safe and working correctly for members. Machines and equipment will wear down with constant use every day by members, and the manager not only needs to monitor it but also needs to keep an eye on which machines are used more than others.
Staff Manager
: having a solid foundation of employees can be the heart and core of an organization, and the gym manager has to find the right people that will get the company moving in the proper direction. From organizing team events to ensuring every employee has adequate training (in regards to both educational certifications and medical training – like CPR and AED), a manager also has to learn to discipline appropriately if the time and occasion ever arise, and needs to be able to foster growth and healthy interaction between team members.
These are just a few of the duties of a gym manager; much more goes into it, such as building a sufficient and successful business organization, membership appreciation/outreach, and on-site maintenance. According to Glassdoor
, the average salary range in the United States for a fitness manager is $44,624. Granted, this takes into account experience, education, certifications, and can vary depending on location.
How to Hire a Gym Manager
As the front-line person for most everything in a fitness facility, the hiring of the gym manager should never be taken lightly. This person will end up having multiple roles to play within the business, so finding someone who can wear different caps with ease is imperative to the overall success of the gym.
Gym Manager Job Responsibilities
When searching for the appropriate candidates for your fitness facility, its essential to list the top responsibilities of a gym manager. These include the following:
Designing/maintain a budget
Managing inventory and equipment needs
Understanding and using the studio’s
gym management software
Creating guidelines and rules and then implementing them with staff and co-workers
Hiring the appropriate staff members to meet member needs
Communicating
clearly between both members and staff
Promoting/increasing sales (and therefore member retention)!
This particular list of responsibilities can definitely be changed/expanded as growth allows, but these are some general ideas that potential managers need to be aware of when hiring.
Interview Questions
So, what are some questions that you should ask a potential gym manager? Finding out how they deal with conflict is crucial since there will inevitably be instances of it between both members and employees at one point or another. Have they ever fired someone before? If so, why? Being aware of how they deal with conflict will tell you a lot in regards to how they handle many different uncomfortable situations that will arise.
Another essential question to ask would be in regards to employee and staff motivation. How would you like to see staff grow and move forward? Take into account how they value education and how they would enable their employees to help progress the company forwards. How do you find out what motivates and encourages your co-workers?

An often-overlooked question/topic is in regards to the actual facility itself; ask the potential gym manager how they plan on ensuring a clean and safe facility. Their answer will help let you know if they have the knowledge to maintain a functional gym where people can workout safely and enjoy themselves – all while boosting member morale and retention, which are two of the goals in the long run to keep the business flourishing!
Finding the Right Candidate
Once the job for the gym manager is posted, do your best to the only interview – on the phone, initially – those that meet all qualifications (i.e., experience, education, certifications, and anything else needed). After reviewing work history and why they’d be interested in this job – why here? Why now? – then you can decide if you want to do a face to face interview to move forward.
After the in-person interview is scheduled and done, it is at that point that you can begin to check references and confirm the validity of all certifications. This is typically done after you’ve spoken with the candidate, so you can verify the information they have given you regarding their credentials and relevant work experience.
Qualities to Look for In A Gym Manager
Between training clients, instructing classes, assisting members, and administrative duties, the day to day tasks of a gym manager can vary greatly. In the long run, you’ll want to find someone that is well-rounded in the fitness realm, and who can push a company forward in the right direction. Check out some of the qualities that one should look for in a fitness manager role!
Reliable communicator:
from listening and responding appropriately to members feedback to the daily interactions between team members, finding a gym manager that knows how to interact and communicate with everyone is vital. A good leader isn’t always in the back office though – they’re out on the floor, intermingling with the team and with clients, and that requires the ability to speak to whoever you come across.
Problem solver:
this isn’t to say that there will be a problem every day to solve; however, you want a gym manager that isn’t afraid to brainstorm solutions to issues that may arise, as well as planning out ways to market effectively to keep the ship moving forward. Having a gym manager that can sit down and figure out multiple viable solutions to fitness facility problems shows confidence, and the ability to discern issues at the forefront and how to deal with them appropriately.
Money saver:
we all know that bringing in money is what keeps the lights on and things moving inside a fitness center; without members, programs, and profit, things would sink…and quickly. A gym manager that has a decent background or working experience in profit and loss, budgeting, and sales can be imperative to the overall growth and success of a company. Accounting and business knowledge are a huge plus and learning how they would solve potential revenue and cost issues would be good to know.
Creative thinker:
what kind of programs can a facility implement to gain more members? What new is software out there for fitness centers to improve workflow? These are only two of many questions that could arise in a typical gym setting, and hiring a gym manager that knows how to solve
problems
and is creative with coming up with solutions to everyday facility issues can help with forwarding movement. Is the person you just interviewed to work the fitness floor going to jive with the other employees? Being aware of (and being able to solve) these kinds of matters is vital for a gym manager!
Educator:
a gym manager is the leader of an entire fitness facility; if you compose a team of employees and co-workers that are stagnant in their knowledge, the business won’t progress effectively. Keeping the team up-to-date with the latest in CEC’s, encouraging workshop attendance, coordinating educational team building events, and building and composing programs off of scientific information will keep the team on top of the ever-changing health and wellness knowledge, and will empower employees to give clients and members their best!
Caretaker:
this could be interpreted as a very broad quality to look for in a gym manager, but its an important one in whichever way you look at it. Finding a manager who is humble, caring, trustworthy, and reliable can all fall under the quality of caretaker – and fittingly so since each of those traits is necessary to have a flourishing fitness center and a remarkable team of employees. With a gym manager that embodies all of these redeemable qualities, your facility will be on its way to not only recruiting and keeping members and employees, but it will also be giving the highest standard of care to each realm of the business.
With a combination of these qualities (and many other ones), you’ll have a thriving gym manager leading the team and business in ways you could only imagine!

Which Features to Look for in a Fitness Class Booking App
Not all fitness class booking apps are created equal. The features that truly drive business growth go beyond basic scheduling. Here’s what to prioritize when evaluating your options:
Spot booking
Look for an app that lets members book specific spots in your class. When Tracy wants her favorite spot near the mirror for
pilates
or Jake prefers a bike at the back of
spin class
, they should be able to select it.
This feature
reduces arrival anxiety
and
creates a sense of ownership
that encourages regular attendance. It’s also perfect for classes with station-based equipment where setup matters!
Recurring appointments
Your most loyal members have
consistent routines
. Make it easy for them to book their weekly schedule in one go. The best apps let members set recurring appointments for their Tuesday morning
yoga class
or Thursday evening
HIIT session
.
This “set it and forget it” approach
increases retention
by making your classes part of their weekly habits—
no extra thought required
.

How Recurring Class Bookings Can Boost Your Success
Variable appointment durations
Not every class fits in a neat 60-minute box
. Your booking app should handle 30-minute express classes, 75-minute extended classes, and 90-minute workshops with equal ease.
Flexible duration settings ensure accuracy; they help members plan their day and prevent confusion about start and end times.
Customizable branding
Your booking app shouldn’t look like a generic platform. It should feel like
an extension of your fitness business
with your logo, colors, and fonts throughout the entire experience.
Strong branding builds trust and reinforces the value you offer
. Members should feel they’re interacting with your business, not a third-party service that just happens to list your classes.
The right combination of these features creates a straightforward booking experience that members actually enjoy using—turning what could be a functional transaction into another positive touchpoint with your brand!

significantly increase attendance rates
and
reduce costly no-shows

virtual classes
within the same platform. Members can easily distinguish between formats when booking. The system automatically delivers virtual class links to registered participants while managing the capacity of your physical space.

The system handles payment processing and automatically updates if you make schedule changes—creating hassle-free consistency for your regulars.
Your Fitness Booking App is a Tool for Business Growth
Don’t settle for just any old booking system. The right app does more than just schedule classes—it drives real business growth by keeping your members engaged and classes full.

80% of fitness staff leave their job
. That is a whopping number and a huge problem for you as a fitness business owner or manager.
Answering the question of how to motivate staff and create a more collaborative and wholesome employee experience is not easy – but there is an answer.
Throughout this guide, we’ll explain exactly how to motivate staff to a level where they are boosting member retention rates, community feeling, and just making the most of their time as a member of your team.
But first, there are a few questions we need to cover.
What is a Staff Retention Strategy?
Basically, this is the method you and your business use to keep your employees happy and working for you. It’s quite a simple equation, but the lower the staff morale is, the quicker you’ll see employees walking out the door.
Creating a staff retention is the first step in improving your employee experience. We’ll show you exactly how to create this strategy shortly, but first, we need you to hear something.
It’s not them, it’s you.
If you are seeing a constant turnover of staff in your business, it’s nobody’s fault but yours. You need to create a deep and forensic audit of your business and managerial style, ensuring that you are creating an experience that leaves your team happy, encouraged, and motivated.

Why Do Employees Leave?
There are a lot of obvious reasons why staff quit, but some can be a little more nuanced. Let’s go through the main contributors to staff leaving fitness businesses.
Salary
This is the go-to reason as to why staff leave a job and, although it can often be the case, it’s not entirely true. More and more people are choosing to work in places that encourage growth and motivation rather than salary. Think about it: would you rather be miserable every day and earning 3% more a year, or motivated, surrounded by friends, and learning everything you need to succeed but at a lower salary?
You’re a fitness business owner, so it’s likely that you’ve already chosen option B, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take a look at your pay rates and how they match up to the local market.
A far more contentious issue for staff is equal pay within the business. If people find out they’re being underpaid in relation to other staff, you’ve already lost them. Make sure you have those difficult and uncomfortable conversations with your team around pay, because if you don’t they’ll have them without you around.
Overworked and Unsupported
Working in the fitness business is not for the faint of heart, and it does require a lot of passion and even more energy. Make sure that all of your staff are working at sustainable levels. Sure, your star trainer can push and do 60-hour weeks, but for how long?
Remember, fitness professionals are often very fond of pushing themselves, it comes with the industry, so don’t just take their word for it when they say they’re fine. Take a look at everyone’s work schedules, understand exactly where the pressure points are, and make sure everyone is taking their fair share of work.
Finally, make sure there’s room for criticism and ideas. Setting up an anonymous feedback system can ensure that you hear about the small problems before they become major fires. Even just a box in the break room where people can drop their thoughts on a piece of paper can have a huge effect on your staff morale.
Lack of Opportunity
Let’s face it: there is nothing more soul-destroying than a dead-end job. Give your staff the opportunity to grow and develop; it could be a major benefit to you in the long run. If you have a passionate, committed staff member, go the extra mile and pay or partly fund
their training or certification. After all, you’re most likely planning on setting up an additional location in the near future, and you’re not going to be able to manage both locations on your own.
Give people the chance to impress you, and to impress yourself, and you’ll often be surprised at how quickly you see results.

Work-Life Balance
Unless the building is on fire, don’t reach out to your staff on their days off. It’s illegal in some countries, and it is a major contributor to bad morale. If you find that there is an unavoidable reason to contact someone on their day off, it’s often your fault because you haven’t set up the right communication methods for in-office collaboration.
Secondly, listen to your staff and find out what responsibilities they have outside of work. Childcare, elderly parents, second jobs, volunteer work – there are a myriad of reasons why people may need some extra time outside of work, and you need to provide that space, otherwise they’ll find somewhere that will.
Lack of Employee Recognition
36% of global employees find this the main reason they leave a company
. Find out who is putting in the extra work and reward them for it. In the fitness business, people work hard, because they have a deep passion for fitness and wellness – recognize that. If you see a trainer going the extra mile with a member, staying late to do that extra load of laundry, or just checking in on the newer staff, call them out and celebrate them.
This ties into the need to give your team the room to grow. In some companies, people don’t even know that they’re allowed to go that extra mile – they feel railroaded and confined by rules or protocols: you can change that through encouragement.

Boredom
Check in, sit at reception, smile at the members, secretly check your phone for hours at a time, look up different job listings, and hand in your notice – this is the scenario for a lot of fitness staff, especially in larger franchises.
This doesn’t have to be the case
.
Encourage your staff to have fun, to relax, and to distract themselves when they need to. If they’re doing something tedious or boring, maybe pair them with a team member that you know they get on well with. If you notice them dragging their feet on certain projects, you can ask them why, or you can just assign them to something different.
Stuck doing tedious admin jobs for hours at a time?
We have the solution
Lack of Company Culture
Some gyms and studios are just plain boring: we’ve all stepped foot in one – your business doesn’t have to be the same. Setting up monthly socials, asking people for their ideas on how to improve morale and experience, and even just showing up more relaxed and at ease yourself can have enormous effects on your staff.

Create an environment where people look forward to coming to work – whether that’s through learning, engaging work, or just great benefits and facilities, you need to make them feel welcome and included in your team.
Hates Their Boss
It happens, and it happens far more often than people think. People can quickly grow angry and resentful towards their boss or manager, and it’s often down to poor managerial styles.
Take a deep look at how you interact and encourage your staff – how often are you passive-aggressive? How often are you seeing issues weeks too late to be addressed? How often do you hear a lull in conversation when you walk into the room?
As a business owner or manager, you need to be a motivator and coach, not an enforcer. Create an environment where people feel that your managerial style is helping them to learn, develop, and thrive. Otherwise, you’re just going to become their enemy, and then it’s only a matter of time before they leave.
Why Learning How to Motivate Staff Makes You Money
Boosts Member Retention
If you have a revolving door of staff in your business, your members will never be able to create a rapport with your staff. By creating a close-knit and collaborative team, you can create a more engaging and community-focused experience for your members.
In the modern fitness industry, there is nothing more important than that community feeling. It can make or break businesses, and it’s a lot easier to develop than you think.

Lower Hiring Costs
There is nothing more time-draining for managers than finding new staff. Sifting through applications, hosting interviews, going through onboarding processes – these are actually losing you a significant amount of money. Every hour that a manager spends on hiring is an hour they’re not spending with members or in maintaining your business. This hour is going to be added in somewhere else, and your manager isn’t going to be as effective as they’re distracted or tired from the hiring process.
This isn’t even mentioning advertising, agencies, and all the other costs that come from new hires.
Keeping a staff member in-house can save you
months
of lost time and productivity.

6 Key Tips For How to Motivate Staff
Learning how to motivate staff can come in a wide variety of forms, but its implementation should always be the same: through humility, understanding, and active listening. You’re going to be experimenting as a business owner, it’s the only way to truly learn the perfect recipe for you and your team, but you need to be able to hear and accept the feedback when it comes to you.
That being said, here are the best ways of creating a motivating environment for your staff.
1. Career Development
There is nothing more poisonous to a job’s longevity than a lack of career development. We mentioned it before, but you need to be a champion of your staff: encouraging them to develop themselves both personally and professionally. By encouraging training and fulfillment within your business, you’re creating a team of highly experienced individuals who can help take you and your company to the next level.
2. Health Benefits
If you are a fitness club owner or have a business in this sector, you should want the best for your staff as you do for your current
members
.
This isn’t just about providing health insurance to your staff, but also including other benefits and perks for being a part of your team.
You’re a fitness business owner, managing fitness professionals: health and wellness should be at the core of everything you do. Along with providing free membership or classes at your own business, you should see if you can provide discounts or free experiences from your business partners or in other areas. Small touches can go a long way in this regard.
3. Work-Life Balance
Keep an active tab on your staff’s outside needs and requirements. If they have childcare, eldercare, or any other type of need outside of work, you have to ensure they are able to cater to it. You also need to stay on top of work scheduling, ensuring that one person isn’t stuck in the gym or studio all weekend, every weekend.
Again, feedback is everything in this regard, make sure to listen to your staff.
4. Retirement Plans
Nobody can be a fitness professional forever. By including a retirement plan into your employee policy, you can create a large amount of loyalty within your staff. Not only do they appreciate the benefit, it also shows that you see them as a long-term investment, not just a temporary employee.
5. Stay Interviews
At a minimum, you should be having a review with all of your staff every quarter.
Sometimes, people find it hard to bring up issues that may be important to them, and these interviews can be the perfect opportunity. Create an open and engaging space where your staff can explain their passions, likes, dislikes, and complaints. You may surprised at what they have to say.
6. Effective Communication
Leaving the best til last: this is by far the best way of learning how to motivate staff in the long term. Educate and train yourself on how to effectively communicate with your team members. Without it, your business will crumble.
Along with in-person communication, ensure that your staff always have the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback. Anything from a suggestions box to an anonymous online survey can provide you with all the info you need to create a more positive and engaging work environment.
Don’t Just be a Boss, Be a Mentor
Creating a clear and open relationship with your staff is not the easiest task in this world, but it is possible. You can learn how to motivate staff by practicing empathy, encouraging feedback, and taking time to audit your current work practices.
There is no faster way to improve the energy and atmosphere of your gym than by ensuring you have a team of inspired and motivated staff.

If you’re thinking about opening a gym, you’ve come to the right place!
If you’re asking the question “how to open a gym?” then you’re already halfway there. Whether you see yourself opening
a bespoke Pilates studio
or running
a high-energy training facility
, this guide will put you in the right headspace.
Opening a gym is exciting—
but it also comes with a learning curve.
You have to make endless decisions and plan like a pro. You’ll have to build budgets, secure permits, choose equipment, and market your launch.
There’s a lot to do before you open your doors.
Don’t sweat, we’ve got you covered. We’ll walk you through every major step so you can move from grand idea to
grand opening
with confidence.
Ready to open your dream gym? Roll up your sleeves and let’s get started.
How Much Does It Cost to Open a Gym?
One of the biggest questions people have when opening a gym is,
“How much is this going to cost?”
The truth is, gym startup costs vary depending on the
size
,
location
, and
type
. It doesn’t matter whether you’re starting a
grassroots dance studio
or have Equinox-level aspirations. Either way, you’ll need a clear budget.
Here’s a breakdown of typical gym startup costs:
What You Need
Estimated Cost Range
Lease or purchase of space
$6,000–$10,000/month
Renovations and build-out
$20,000–$100,000+
Fitness equipment
$10,000–$100,000+
Licensing, permits & insurance
$5,000–$15,000+
Staffing and payroll
$30,000–$60,000/year per employee
Marketing and branding
$5,000–$20,000+
Gym management software
$150–$300/month
Total estimated cost

If you’re building a gym from the ground up, these numbers
can climb even higher
—
especially
if you’re looking at a large space including showers, locker rooms, or retail areas.
Another path to consider is
franchising
. While the initial investment may be higher—ranging from around
$350,000 for F45
to over
$1 million for Planet Fitness
—
franchises help you save on branding, equipment sourcing, and site selection.
You’ll also benefit from access to a proven business model and get treated to ongoing operational support. All of this reduces guesswork and makes it easier to open your own gym with confidence.
(
Pro tip
:
Buying
used or refurbished equipment
can save you thousands without sacrificing quality!)
Regardless of the route you choose,
the first step is a detailed gym business plan template and budget.

6 Steps to Opening a Gym or Fitness Studio
How to Open a Gym: Must-Have Checklist
Opening a gym is a big commitment
and
a big opportunity
. From legal paperwork to equipment choices, there are a lot of moving parts. We’ve organized our checklist for opening a gym into four categories to help make sure you don’t forget any crucial pieces.
Just like
our award-winning software
, this list will help you stay organized, avoid mistakes, and build a foundation for growth.
#1: Plans and paperwork
From research to planning and funding, there’s a lot that happens before you even switch on the lights!
Here’s a checklist of first steps as you begin to build your business:
Research your market and competitors (if you know
your target market
and your main competition, you’ll better meet your members’ needs)
Write a
flawless gym business plan
Choose your business structure, and get a license and tax ID number
Secure funding (learn more about
gym financing
)
Get a certificate of occupancy to prove your space is safe and up to code
Get the necessary health and safety inspections
Secure
general liability insurance
(plus workers’ compensation if you hire staff)
Secure local permits like zoning approval, signage, and fire safety
Requirements vary by location. It’s smart to consult with a local small business attorney or accountant to ensure compliance. Check out the
U.S. Small Business Administration
for guidance based on your state and industry.
#2: Location, location…equipment!
Your gym’s success begins with where it’s located and how well it’s equipped. Here are a few tips to get these key factors right:
Choose a space with high foot traffic or easy parking
Consider the type of gym you’re opening—boutique studio, strength training gym, hybrid space, etc.
Make sure your gym type aligns with your
target demographic
and their wants/goals (young professionals, parents, older adults, etc.)
Review your lease terms closely, especially build-out rights, signage restrictions, and early-exit clauses
Choose
high-quality machines
and functional fitness gear
Factor in delivery, assembly, and maintenance costs
Pro tip
: Franchises often provide bulk discounts on equipment and offer a gym setup checklist you can follow from day one.
“I went and [opened a gym] because I never really thought of going on any other path. To me, it was just like
this is where I want to be
. This is where I want to spend my time. This is what I want to do.”
– Mike Lipowski, founder and owner of
Pure Physique
#3: Staff and systems
You can’t do everything yourself.
Hiring qualified staff
and trusting them to own key responsibilities is a huge part of running a successful gym. You’ll also want to make sure day-to-day operations run smoothly. Here’s how:
Recruit
certified and skilled
trainers and friendly front-desk staff who align with your gym’s values and culture
Create a standardized onboarding process and provide regular training to ensure consistent service quality
Clearly outline job duties to avoid confusion and keep workflows efficient
Delegate tasks like scheduling, front desk duties, and social media
Use a gym management platform (like
ABC Glofox
) to handle scheduling, billing, member communication, and reporting
Document daily tasks (e.g., opening/closing checklists, cleaning schedules, emergency procedures) to keep operations consistent and scalable
#4: Spread the word
You could have the best gym in town, but it won’t grow if no one knows about it. Here’s how to get the word out and bring in your first 100 members:
Build a pre-launch marketing plan at least 60 days before opening
Create a
simple, mobile-ready website
with a widget for online sign-ups
Promote your gym opening on social media and with local ads
Offer limited-time founding member discounts or
referral rewards
Partner with nearby businesses (like smoothie bars or physios) for mutual promotion
Marketing is ongoing, so set aside a budget for monthly campaigns. Complete the picture with a gym management toolkit like
ABC Glofox
that offers built-in marketing tools.
Tips for Running a Successful Gym Business
Once your gym is up and running, the real work begins:
keeping the chain well-oiled for the long road ahead
. From managing your team to delivering
a standout member experience
, how your gym runs from Monday to Sunday packs an even bigger punch than the launch party your community is
still
talking about.
For newbies and experienced fitness veterans alike, these tips will help you build a gym that runs like a freshly-tuned spin bike—keeping members happy and giving you room to grow.
Build a welcoming culture
Your gym might have the best equipment in town, but if the vibe’s off,
members won’t stick around.
Build a “members first” gym that feels like a second home—clean, friendly, and motivating. This includes:
Greeting members by name
Keeping locker rooms and equipment clean
Offering
group classes
or events to build community
Responding quickly to feedback or complaints
Retention starts with relationships, and satisfied members will become your best promoters.

, and
delivering an even better member experience
.
Know your numbers, track performance, and adapt
What gets measured gets managed
. Keep an eye on
key metrics like monthly recurring revenue (MRR), churn rate, member referrals, and class attendance

Around
45%
of the world’s population use social media, with
60%
saying they are always connected and
98%
having used it in the past month. People now spend an
average
of 2 hrs and 23 minutes on a social media platform every day, and 53 of those minutes get spent on Instagram alone. In the past, we’ve talked about
creating a killer Instagram strategy for your fitness business.
Now it’s time to add Instagram influencer marketing into the mix.
In this article, we’ll highlight how you can use influencer marketing on Instagram to grow your fitness business. First, we’ll take a quick look at Instagram’s growth and what influencer marketing actually means. Skip ahead to:
The Growth of Instagram
Flashback to February 2013 when Instagram was a toddler compared to its competitor social networks. With a modest 100 million users, the platform jumped to 200 million in March the following year. Before the end of 2014, users had increased again by 100 million, leaving Instagram with 300 million users by the end of December 2014.
In 2016, the platform launched its game-changing feature, stories
encouraging over 500 million of its users to share more than ever. Bringing us a little closer to the present, Instagram proudly announced that it had reached 1 billion daily users by June 2018.
With popular Instagram taking over – we’re more connected through the media platform than ever before. But it’s safe to say that social network feeds have naturally become more cluttered. Information overload leaves users scrolling mindlessly through their feeds and no longer relying on the home feed alone to see the content they like. People are following accounts that cater to a specific interest; knowing they can depend on that account to see relevant content each time. Competition to get noticed amongst the clutter is fierce. Audiences are taking their loyalty, interactions, and what they see into their own hands; by opting to put more of their trust in social media influencers.
Enter: Instagram Influencer Marketing.
Recent figures
from Traackr highlight the momentum of the influencer marketing industry, with the number of companies implementing influencer campaigns growing from
28%
to
47%.
In a recent report,
Linqia
revealed that this content has been extremely useful for those who have implemented the sponsored post/campaign.
57%
of survey respondents reported that influencer content outperformed brand-created content. In a similar
report
from influencer marketing platform Tomoson;
51%
of respondents believe they acquire better customers through influencer marketing. The study also found that businesses are making $6.50 for every $1 spent on influencer marketing.
What Is Influencer Marketing?
Influencer marketing focuses on targeting famous industry leaders with a high engagement rate on social media. These influencers will then promote brand awareness and drive brand messaging to a specific group of consumers. Sometimes in the form of a sponsored post,
42%
of marketers now have an always-on strategy in place when it comes to influencer marketing. Over
68%
cite Instagram as the most important social network for influencer marketing in 2019.

Benefits Of Instagram Influencer Marketing:
Reach a more extensive volume of your target audience
Promote brand awareness
Improve engagement rate with authenticity
Influencer marketing, combined with Instagram’s mass presence in social media users today proves that your digital marketing needs to include Instagram influencer marketing. We’ve covered this briefly before as one of our
9 Top Social Media Tips For Fitness Business Success
, and now we’re diving deeper into the topic. Here’s what you need to prepare a successful Instagram influencer marketing strategy for your fitness studio.
How to Work With Influencers
It’s easy enough to come across social media influencers, but don’t be tempted to start reaching out to every single one you see. There are a couple of simple areas to consider when you’re starting to source influencers to work with. The points below will get you thinking about your strategy and ultimately, your long-term plan for Instagram influencer marketing.
1. Brand Alignment
There are literally thousands of fitness/wellbeing influencers on Instagram. Each social media influencer is usually best known for something specific. It could be their objective; see
@lucymountain
as an example for ‘calling out fitness bs’, or maybe their aesthetic. Are they best known for being a fitness model? Make sure you’re thinking about your studio, your brand, and how your values align with your chosen influencers. You want to
keep your brand consistent across social media.
Influencers are versed content creators. So picking the right people to collaborate with will mean that the content they post about you will come across as genuine and authentic to your audience.
2. Target Audience
If you’re considering the previous point on brand alignment; you’ll naturally be thinking about your audience. Your audience should be at the forefront of your mind when devising any part of your digital marketing strategy; who will appeal to and resonate most with them?
3. Content
When you’ve found fitting influencers, make sure you brief them properly in keeping their content authentic. A recent
survey
shows that
90%
of consumers say authenticity is important when deciding which brands they like and support. Transparency is key if a post is sponsored; followers should know they are viewing a sponsored post. An influencer will create a range of content for you. It could be an Instagram photo, sponsored post, video, or any type of media.
Your wider social media content strategy will help you choose which is best. Keep in mind that while you’ll brief your influencer on your brand and target audience; they know what works for their audience. They know what’s popular on Instagram and the type of post that will get high engagement from their followers. Determining your niche will help you find the best influencers to work with, but the best content post will come from collaborating with and listening to your influencer.
4. Calculate A Budget. Find Your Niche
Most studio founders would race through a thousand burpees (or at least try) to have the likes of
Michelle Lewin
or
Kayla Itsines
talking about their brand on social. While these vast players may seem like the pinnacle of your influencer marketing campaign, it’s probably better to focus your efforts on smaller, more niche influencers. Cultivate relationships with accounts that have a more modest following of loyal and engaged users, but with a more narrow focus in terms of content. It’s essential to shift your focus from quantity to quality; an influencers follower count isn’t the be all end all.
For example, say you’re a London-based boxing studio.
Which influencer is more likely to resonate with your customers and drive results:
– A U.S-based general fitness influencer with 250,000+ followers globally, great images, and high engagement.
– A London-based boxing influencer with 10,000 followers predominantly in the UK, great images, high engagement.

It sounds simple, but that first impression of an influencer with a huge following could distract you from collaborating with someone more aligned with your brand and customers. This approach will benefit your Instagram influencer marketing performance in the long-run.
With a defined budget in mind, the Instagram influencer marketing industry is yours to experiment with. Generally speaking, influencers with a following of more than 100,000 will be more expensive to work with. Those with under 100,000 followers are classed as ‘micro-influencers’ so their pricing will reflect this.
Speaking about building a network of local fitness influencers on The Fitness Founders Podcast, Stuart Brauer, founder of
WTF Gym Talk
has some insightful tips on keeping your influencer strategy close to home:
“Instead of one person with 100,000 followers, how about 50 of your clients that each have 1,000 followers. Who follows Sally, who’s been a member of your gym for two years? Sally’s friends, family, and co-workers. So why don’t you make your clients your influencer? You don’t have to strike up a contract, not a deal. You invite them in for a photoshoot, give them a free shirt with your brand on it, take some amazing photos of them, give it to them for free. Give them the photos and ask that they share them whenever they want.”
Considering the simple points above will help you begin mapping out your influencer marketing strategy. Defining a long term vision is key with any marketing campaign – especially when it comes to ROI, increasing engagement, and measuring performance.
How to Measure Campaign Performance
One of the most crucial steps in creating any Instagram influencer marketing campaign is to establish clear goals and objectives. This will enable you to track your campaign performance. Common influencer marketing goals include:
Increase your target customer reach
Increase sales/sign ups
Promote brand advocacy
Manage brand reputation
Increase engagement
While these goals are a great example of where you should begin, they’re also broad. To make sure you’re taking the right approach to the influencer marketing industry; dive deeper. Setting goals from a more granular level will make tracking your ROI easier – and most importantly, more accurate.
Clear, Well-Defined Goals Should:
Have a set tracking period.
For example: set a timeline to track your engagement rate increase within the first three weeks of launch.
Be specific.
A general goal to ‘increase revenue’ is hard to track. Define the increase you want to see, either in percentage or monetary value.
Be realistic.
This is especially important if you’re venturing into influencer marketing campaigns for the first time. It doesn’t mean setting below-average performance goals; it just means keeping your determinations for success achievable. You can push the boundaries further each time.
Once you’ve established your goals, it’s time to set some metrics to measure. You don’t have to pick just one parameter to realize whether you’ve reached your goal. For example: say your campaign goal is to promote brand awareness. Your metrics could combine brand mentions, follower growth, engagement rate, number of impressions/clicks, etc. If you’re struggling to determine what ‘good’ metrics might look like for your brand, look to others for inspiration. According to Linqia’s study, almost
90%
of marketers use engagement as a metric when it comes to influencer marketing campaigns. This is followed by Impressions at
67%
, Brand Awareness at
65%
and Clicks at
63%.
At less than
50%
, fewer are tracking influencer marketing efforts to sales.
Establishing Your Goals And Metrics Is The First Step
If you’re new to Instagram influencer marketing, you want to start it right. Managing, monitoring, and hopefully exceeding goals and expectations is where your Instagram influencer marketing campaigns can start to take off. In the long-term, an influencer marketing platform can help with tracking your influencer marketing ROI and monitoring performance by making the process simple.

Few approaches are as lucrative as email marketing when it comes to pricing, return on investment (ROI) and improving brand awareness.
The large volumes of prospective consumers that you can reach with email are unmatchable through traditional marketing channels.
For gym owners, a compatible email marketing strategy could mean a growing clientele.
That’s because worldwide, the number of email users is growing. And it’s estimated that there’ll be around
4.3 billion email users
by the end of 2023. That’s almost half of the world’s population!
This makes email marketing a wonderful opportunity that small business owners can’t afford to miss out on.
In this article, we will look at the importance of email marketing, the benefits of email marketing and list some top tips to help you become successful with this marketing channel.

Importance and benefits of email marketing
for effective email marketing
Why do gyms need email marketing?
Email marketing is a way for brands to send carefully curated emails to their target audiences. The purpose is to lead potential customers to your business website in order to increase sales.
It can help gym owners take their business to the next level. Email marketing campaigns are a cost-effective way to gain personal, day-to-day access to your customers.
Emails help accelerate your marketing efforts and build relationships with your clients.
But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Some more reasons to add email marketing to your to-do list are:
Personalized experiences
Your gym members might need personalized content that you can’t put on social media. This can include meal plans, workouts, progress reports and discount offers.
Email marketing allows you to offer these to your customers much more efficiently.
Cost-effective to enter
The low investment makes email marketing a remarkable low-risk marketing strategy for small businesses and new gyms. Plus, it can give you the highest ROI. You can expect around a
42$ return on
every marketing dollar you invest in email marketing.
Emails inspire actions
Email marketing makes it that much easier for potential clients to take action. A simple click leads them to your landing page, canceling out the extra steps of searching for your accounts on socials or looking up your website on Google.
Whether it’s old members or new customers, email marketing makes it straightforward to book a meeting or check out your website.
Email marketing makes for smooth communication
Email marketing betters the flow of communication between you and your customers while improving the user experience.
For example, suppose a new customer signs up for a membership. You can then send them a welcome email to provide complete information on your personal trainers and keep them updated about upcoming group classes.
You can also prompt answer questions and give updates to your members via email.
Get more reviews
Gyms like many other small businesses rely on reviews and customer feedback. You can combine your promotional emails with a friendly reminder to share a testimonial.
Customers will be more likely to leave a review when it’s as easy as clicking a star rating on your website or page.
Importance and benefits of email marketing
The current business climate is a highly competitive one.
Your gym is most likely facing so much competition that it can be laborious and pricey to reach your marketing goals. If you need a more cost-effective and streamlined way to market your brand, email marketing provides it.
Here are some reasons that show the importance of email marketing for gyms.
1. Open rates
Open rate means the number of people who open and read your email. Emails have some of the highest
open rates – 21%
according to a MailChimp survey. That means you can get many more eyeballs on your marketing material in emails than through other forms of marketing.
2. Cost-effective
Email marketing software are cost-effective in two ways. Firstly they cost just a fraction of what other methods such as renting a billboard or taking out a magazine ad cost.
Secondly, it allows you to spend your investment on a target audience that is much more likely to convert into customers. Email marketing guarantees the highest ROI as compared to other tactics.
3. Reach mobile users
According to research, people check their emails
3 times more
on mobile devices as compared to their desktop computers or laptops. Thus by using emails to distribute your marketing materials you can increase brand awareness and publicity that much more.
4. Supplement your entire marketing strategy
Email marketing is quite versatile.
You can combine it with other marketing channels such as social media marketing or content marketing to design a more wholesome and balanced marketing strategy. This can have a higher impact and you can increase brand awareness more diversely.
5. Helps you build relationships
Not all emails you send out will be the same. Different members in your email list will receive different emails. You’ll have one strategy for your potential customers and another for your loyal gym-goers.
Email marketing allows you to personalize and better the user experience in a way that social media can’t.
6. Email marketing is measurable
With more orthodox methods of marketing such as pamphlets, it can be difficult to accurately
measure results
. But email marketing provides real-time feedback and analytics.
For that, you can use key performance indicators (KPIs) such as open rate and click-through rates.

It lets you take out all the guesswork, making it simpler to monitor your campaign and measure your marketing efforts in numbers rather than assumptions. Email marketing helps you figure out what’s working, and double down on that approach.
7. Better than social media
Social media is a great tool for brand awareness and for starting the conversation. But email marketing is what keeps the conversation going.
Conversion rates from prospective to permanent clients are enhanced with email marketing. According to the WRB Digital and Emarsys survey,
81% of small businesses
use email marketing for customer acquisition while 51% use social media.
Social media also comes with the inconvenience of unpredictability. Email marketing saves you from the ever-changing advertisement policies and algorithm upgrades.
8. Increases brand awareness
There are so many ways email marketing can help with brand awareness. Be it newsletters, seasonal discounts, promotional emails, or any updates about internal upgrades about your gym.
Email marketing delivers your logo and brand name directly into your possible clients’ inboxes. Even if they don’t open or buy something right away, you can rest easy knowing that you’ve advertised your gym to them.
And since we’ve already covered that emails get opened much more than notifications and social media posts, it’s great for
brand awareness
.
9. Reach customers in real-time
Since emails get delivered almost instantly, it makes them perfect for time-sensitive matters such as flash sales or filling up exercise classes because of sudden cancellations.
Effective email marketing is the proactive approach towards advertising. It can help you reach your customers quicker and more efficiently, helping with customer retention.
10. Helps drive traffic to websites
Email marketing helps make your SEO efforts more successful by increasing your website traffic. You can lead your subscribers directly on your website by using catchy subject lines and relevant email content.
10 tips for effective email marketing
Now you know why email marketing is essential for your gym. So your next step should be to create a marketing campaign. Here are some tips to get you started:
1. Create an email marketing strategy
Email marketing is a tool like any other. You need to have a solid strategy in place to make it work for your brand.
Make sure that your email marketing strategy is reflective of your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) approach. The first step is to identify your target audience and then work on creating engaging email content.
You can try different approaches, such as segmenting your email list to reach maximum new customers. Or pair it with your social media or SEO marketing campaign.
2. Grow your email list
Actively work towards growing your email list.
77% of people
favor permission-based promotional messages via email over other marketing channels.
Recruit subscribers from your frequent gym users and social media. Design a welcome email using a template proven to bring results. Use personalization to your advantage to stay relevant.
And make sure to remain consistent with emails that are interesting to your readers. These can be newsletters, diet plans, reminders of upcoming classes, and events that they might enjoy.
3. Develop your email marketing campaign
There are many elements you can incorporate into your email marketing campaign. Welcome emails, teasers of any new products, pricing guides, and details of collaborating retailers are some options that can elevate your campaign.
All these are instruments to target potential customers and optimize brand awareness.
4. Mobile device optimization
Leverage the power of hand-held devices to your advantage by designing your email accordingly.
Customers who open an email first on their cell phone, then open that exact email again on another device, are
65% more likely to click through
to your website or promotion.
This is an especially clever way to reach a younger audience. Nearly
73% of 18-24-year-olds
use their phones to check email.
5. Automate the process
Automation is how you streamline the process of email marketing. It’s less labor-intensive and the key to organizing your gym’s advertising efforts.
Email marketing automation makes the process of distributing your content focused and to the point. There are many email marketing services you can utilize for this purpose such as MailChimp, Drip and ConvertKit.
6. Troubleshoot your unsubscribe rates
Expanding the number of subscribers is important but equally crucial in lowering your unsubscribe rates. It’s much easier today to
grow your email list
and understand the dynamics that caused its decline because of the advancement in tracing and analytic tools available now.
Try out your email content on test groups through a/b testing and dig deep into the analytics. This might help you understand the metrics and what prompts customers to unsubscribe.
7. Improve your subject lines of promotional emails
The subject line is the predecessor of your entire email marketing effort. Writing effective emails is the key to a good email marketing strategy and that begins with the subject line.
Put in the time to understand market dynamics and increase your know-how about what your readers want. This might enable you to meticulously plan your subject lines to be intriguing and interesting.
8. Use templates
Instead of re-inventing the wheel, make use of countless resources available online. Use
email templates
to draft marketing emails.
9. Segment your email list
Segmentation can help you target users in different stages of the funnel. User segmentation enables you to use diversity to your advantage by aiming different marketing content towards different types of users within your email list.
This is a less strenuous and more effective approach than a generalized advertisement campaign.
10. Don’t forget to follow up
Follow up with a consistent trickle of emails to keep engagement high. This could be an automated birthday email with a discount code or freebie or a twice-monthly newsletter. Keep your call-to-action phrasing short and sweet yet compelling.
In summary
The business environment is transitioning and with that, so should your approach towards marketing. Email marketing could prove to be the missing element you need to accelerate your business growth.

gym management software
to automate messages for your customers and get analytics that can help you create an effective email marketing strategy.

key features
to look out for when
choosing gym management software
. Selecting a software provider is a huge decision and with such a broad array of competing options available, it’s vital that you drill down to your exact business requirements.
Affiliate management software features can be broken down into core and value added features. The core features consist of the features which affiliate gym owners require in order to effectively automate time consuming admin tasks. The value added features on the other hand, include add-ons which are ‘nice to have’, but are not necessarily critical to the running and administration of your box.
Set out below are a list of the core and value added features which your affiliate management software should provide to ensure your software becomes a powerful business tool.
Online Class Scheduling
The gym management software solution that you choose should take the pain out of scheduling classes, courses and facilities. Creating and updating your schedule will take just minutes and all attendances will be recorded to help you make tomorrow’s business decisions more informed.
Mobile Booking
As those of you who read our last blog post will know, the future of fitness is mobile and any software provider who doesn’t have mobile as part of their core strategy isn’t worth your time. Your members should have the ability to
seamlessly book in for a class
with just a few taps- anytime, anywhere.
Membership Management
You should have the option to create
unlimited configurable membership types
based on your affiliate gym’s own unique criteria. Ensure your membership options are catered for, for example monthly, quarterly or annual subscriptions, class based packages or pay-as-you-go drop-ins.
Automated Payments
Avoid late payments and lost revenue by setting up recurring payments that
bill automatically
for your members. By simplifying payments for loyal customers, you’re giving them a greater experience, keeping them happy and committed, while simultaneously stabilizing your cashflow. Win win!
Automated Waiting List
You want to make things as easy as possible for your members and thus, the ability to cancel a booking with the touch of a button is vital. Ensure the gym management software you choose has an automatic waiting list feature which becomes enabled as soon as your class hits capacity. A simple, yet intuitive way of making sure your classes and facilities are always full.

Reporting
Your affiliate gym management software should give you access to a reporting suite with the
key metrics that matter to your business
in an instant so you can make decisions that help your crossfit business grow. Key metrics include attendance rates, retention rates and of course revenue. You should also review the trainers and classes that are driving attendance. Keeping track of these figures will help you take advantage of trends and make data driven business decisions.
Website and Social Media Integration
Integrating your fitness schedule right into your website gives your members an alternative means of viewing your information. Being fully integrated with
social media networks
allows your members to do the work for you through the creation of a buzz around your box by sharing your content.
Access Control and Monitoring
Depending on your box requirements, you may choose a software provider which is integrated with access control systems to give your athletes a more seamless check-in.
Auto Alerts and Notifications
Setting predefined automated
alerts and notifications
related to issues which require immediate resolution, such as billing errors, ensures critical issues are not left unresolved. It also allows you to communicate with your members and drive engagement. Scheduling automated reminders for members that have not attended a class in quite some time will help boost your member retention.
Online Waivers and Documents
Having your members sign their waivers online or through your business app keeps your fitness business paperless and secure.
Custom Branded App
You’ve worked hard to create your brand so why not choose a software provider that understands this? Why not have a
mobile app
that is custom branded to your box, reinforcing what your crossfit community stands for? The better the experience for your athletes, the less likely they are to hop from box to box.
Community Building
Having the ability to engage your
crossfit community
by keeping members informed with reminders and notifications is a powerful feature. Build on that community you have with a software which provides an application with in-app chat features that allow members to message trainers and even each other directly from your app.

11 Gym Membership Sales Strategies to Attract, Convert and Retain Members
Grow Your Fitness Business With Solid Membership Sales Strategies
Over the last year, fitness businesses have explored creative ways to drive membership sales and generate revenue. In a bid to keep members on board throughout health club closures, reduced capacity, and lockdowns, many businesses are now running with a hybrid model. As restrictions come and go throughout the world, you can look toward the future to determine what new membership sales strategies you need to grow your fitness business.
You’re no longer just selling a membership, you’re selling a membership during a pandemic. To get members through the door, you need to create a new level of trust and assurance like never before. Although more and more people are looking to head back to the gym and socialize, you will need to offer complete reassurance and build confidence to encourage both new members and previous members back through the door.
Whether you’re fully reopen, running at a reduced capacity, or are yet to open to your members, a solid membership sales strategy is essential for driving revenue. Without a process in place, your sales team doesn’t have the tools to sell effectively.
As community becomes even more important, you can create a positive fitness community that’s a selling point in itself. Health and fitness are a clear priority right now.
Obesity is a risk factor for severe COVID-19
. This new level of awareness will propel the fitness industry forward and allow you to potentially target new customers.
Membership Sales Strategies in 2021: Niche Down and Sell a Transformation
In the fitness industry, there are a lot of places and people that can serve your target audience. Whether you started your business broad or already have a niche, now is the time to niche down. The more relevant your solution is to the people you are selling to, the more likely they are to commit to a sale.
Although it sounds like you’re narrowing down your potential customer base, it means that you will be selling to prospects who are open to your business. You will be able to continue this level of hyper-relevancy throughout the customer journey which not only helps with sales but increases member retention. Your niche should be compelling and add value to a person’s life.
When you’re selling a product or service, you’re looking to meet your buyer’s needs and goals. It’s important to continue to remind your prospect of the transformation you’re selling. It’s not about a monthly payment or number of classes, it’s about losing weight and feeling the best they have ever felt. Maybe they want to get fitter and feel more confident or run their first marathon. Either way, when you lead with the transformation and the benefit, you increase the strength of your value proposition offer. People are willing to pay a higher price for a transformation than a product.

4 Key Points of a Strong Membership Sales Strategy
Your marketing campaign is key to attracting potential members but without a solid sales strategy in place, it will be harder to close sales effectively. To create the best and most effective sales process, you need to focus on the skills and messages your sales reps need to communicate. Think about how your
sales team
will communicate value to potential customers. Here are four key points of a strong membership sales strategy.
Creates Genuine Connections
The ability to create genuine human connections is a massive part of being successful in sales. When someone is warm, funny, informative, and genuine, it creates a positive experience and connection with a potential customer. When you actively show interest in someone else’s problems rather than just try to make someone interested in your services, it can switch up your sales.
Sells a Solution
In health and fitness, it’s important that you show empathy during the sales journey. One of the best ways to do this is to sell a solution, rather than a service. By finding out your prospect’s needs and goals, you can create a solution to a problem that can impact their life. If they want to start working out more but don’t know what they are doing, you would recommend some personal training sessions and maybe a virtual coach to keep them accountable when starting out. Selling solutions is about selling value.
Uses an Effective Sales Process
A good membership sales strategy has a sales process in place. It’s a set of repeatable steps that takes a potential customer from a stranger to a member. Your sales process consists of lead management, prospecting, handling objections, follow-up, and, ultimately, closing the deal. A winning sales process has clearly defined steps and is managed. It means that prospects don’t get forgotten about. The majority of the time, it takes a few conversations to close a sale. So, the sales process is integral to selling memberships effectively.

Understands the Entire Customer Journey
The customer journey is a roadmap to how your customer feels at each part of the sales process. By having a deep understanding of the entire customer journey, you can have a good idea of when you are most likely to close a sale. The customer journey is the experience your customer has with your brand. Your customer journey is a key part of your marketing and sales strategy.
11 Gym Membership Sales Strategies to Attract, Convert and Retain Members
Your gym membership sales strategy needs the right kind of energy and planning to sell effectively. Now is the time to seize new opportunities and find creative ways to improve your membership sales and build your customer base. Here are 11membership sales strategies to attract and convert new clients.
1. Identify and Understand Your Niche
When you have a clear understanding of your niche, you attract the right kind of prospects. Chasing unproductive leads is time-consuming and wastes valuable resources. By understanding your niche, you can determine your ideal member profile. No matter how skillful you are, some people will never commit to a membership. Your niche will help you to create member personas and also help you nail your marketing strategy down the line.
2. Nail Your Lead Management Strategy
Managing leads is a key part of the overall process. It’s how you capture leads and track all the touchpoints with your brands like email, calls, and website activity. It includes the process of qualifying leads and nurturing prospects so that you can sell and close sales more effectively. Lead management software is useful in managing leads and can make it much easier to keep track of the process.
3. Upsell Relevant Services to Your Existing Members
Upselling is not only great for your business but for your current members too. It’s essential that any upselling is uber-relevant. The aim is to help your members get the best results possible. You are the authority in fitness and should upsell solutions that will help members to achieve their goals. If you know that a member is struggling with healthy eating, you would upsell your nutritional services. If a member is trying to beat a personal best, why not recommend a personal training session that aligns precisely with the member’s goals.
4. Start a Podcast
Podcasting is skyrocketing in popularity. Your podcast can become an essential tool in your sales and marketing strategy. The reason for this is that it gives you the chance to connect with people on a whole new level. It’s a medium that gives you the opportunity to talk for hours and go in-depth into a subject. Once you have a growing base of subscribers, they will listen to what you have to say. A podcast is an excellent tool for generating leads and building your brand.
5. Invest Fully in Social Media Marketing
Although it seems a little obvious to include social media marketing in this list, your social media channels are powerful sales tools. You can drive sales with social media. You can integrate your social media strategy into your sales process to increase engagement. Try sharing member success stories, social listening, and running social media ads.
6. Follow-Up is Everything
Constant follow-up is key to sales in the fitness industry. The best fitness studios and gyms follow up with every lead until they make a sale or determine that the lead is not going anywhere. With most sales, you hear a lot of no’s before you hear a yes. Without follow-up, you lose a lot of sales. Re-evaluate your follow-up process and make sure that enough resources are put into it.
7. Evaluate Your Sales Strategy
It’s always a good idea to evaluate your sales strategy. It’s normal for your business to evolve. If you have launched an online offering or are running digital fitness workshops alongside your in-person services, your business has changed. Evaluate your current sales strategy and make sure that it’s still working for your business. You may need to adjust your offer and craft a reopening sales strategy.
8. Re-Engage Ex Gym Members
Throughout the pandemic, financial uncertainty and job losses forced many people to make sacrifices. While some people may have kept paying gym memberships, others froze theirs, and some people cancelled them altogether. You have the opportunity to reach out and re-engage members you have lost during the pandemic. Perhaps they would benefit from your new digital fitness offering with flexible pricing or are in a better financial position and would love some help getting back in shape.
9. Use Marketing Automation
Marketing and sales go hand-in-hand. They often crossover and compliment each other. By automating your marketing it can streamline and monitor routine membership marketing tasks. But on top of this, it can help you to close more sales. It can help to provide your sales team with information about leads, keep your brand fresh with triggered emails, track results, and monitor leads on every channel.
10. Leverage Email Marketing
When done properly, email marketing can help you to attract organic leads and nurture the members you do have. It can do wonders for engagement and is a relatively cost-effective way to boost your marketing and sales. Use email marketing to re-engage inactive members and reach out to members that have left you on your email list.
11. Up Your Content Marketing
A solid content marketing plan supports your overall sales strategy. By pushing out more content and resources, people know who you are and already know what you do before you start speaking to them. When you create helpful content for potential members, it starts building trust and confidence with your brand.
For some content marketing inspiration, Jack Cardy, Managing Director of Live Fit Gym and the Co-founder of Media Bros,
reveals the secrets of a great content marketing strategy
. He talks about building video content and cutting through the noise on social media.
In Summary
The core of sales success in the fitness industry is the absolute belief that what you’re selling is designed to help your members achieve their fitness goals and live a healthier life. You’re selling something that can change a person’s life for the better. When you have a dedicated sales strategy and a sales team that has the ability to develop real human connections, you can overcome obstacles and significantly improve your sales performance.

We are excited to share that we’ve made several enhancements to make managing trainers and their availability from the Glofox App even easier.
Here’s a recap video showing you what this appointment feature gives you:
What’s New?
Appointments provides more flexibility around appointment creation and management. Traditionally on the Glofox platform, the Trainer has been associated with one appointment duration and one set price, while also being limited to creating one appointment at a time.
With this new version of appointments, you have the ultimate flexibility to create any appointment type, duration, and price that suits your business. For example, you may want just a quick 30-minute PT session, or maybe a longer 90-minute massage session – all depending on your business type. You can also set up a recurring appointment booking to ensure your loyal clients never miss their spot. These appointments are now fully customizable on the ABC Glofox platform.
Additionally,
you’ll no longer see double bookings on your schedule
. This new update ensures that your trainers are never double booked, ensuring that both the trainers and their clients have full visibility of every single appointment in their upcoming schedule. With the addition of appointment reminder emails and SMS, you can rest assured that your no-shows will reduce.
Here are all the features and benefits available with the updated Appointments Solution:
Variable Appointments:
Flexibility to set any appointment type, with varying durations and prices
Increase revenue potential
by expanding the appointment offering in your studio/gym
Trainer double bookings will no longer be possible
Less reliance on studio admins
to manage the appointments on the trainer’s behalf since the trainer can now schedule their own appointments in the Pro App
Recurring Appointments:
Ability to create recurring appointments on the Dashboard to ensure you secure your clients’ weekly slot
Trainer Availability for client facing appointments:
Admins and Receptionists can set a date-specific or recurring schedule on the Dashboard.
Your clients will be able to view and book the desired appointment type and trainer in the Member App and the Web Portal.
View multiple trainers schedule, or a single trainers’ availability within a single calendar overview.
Filters available: appointment type, time of day, trainer, and availability.
Appointment Reminders:
Ensure your clients never miss an appointment, with appointment email and SMS reminders which are customizable in the Connect section

9 Objectives of Gym Management Systems
How to Choose the Right Gym Management Software for Your Business
What is Gym Management Software?
Gym management software is designed to simplify the running of a fitness club. From online gym scheduling and automated billing to administrative tasks, the software pulls all data into one place so that you can run your business more efficiently.
Without gym member management software, all tasks will need to be carried out separately. For example, you may manage billing through one piece of software, keep track of administrative tasks somewhere else, and use a spreadsheet for financial forecasting. You may have member management information online or offline in the office. Either way, there is no one centralized spot where you can find all the information about your business. Gym management software is designed to streamline operations so that all of these tasks can be in one place.
In a world where technological advances occur so quickly, it can feel like a challenge to keep up. However, gym and fitness clubs can maximize business potential through gym management software. This type of software has gone beyond just processing membership payments and additional admin tools. It can help you manage all facets of the business, retain and engage members, and, most importantly – grow.

Streamline Your Business With a Gym Management System
If you can streamline your business, you can work more effectively. This means there is less time-wasting, and you put the right resources into a task. Having multiple tools or manually completing administrative tasks across various locations will impact efficiency in the long run. Larger gyms, fitness studios, and franchises tend to have more departments and bigger teams.
When you have a constant exchange of information, it can increase the amount of time you need to spend on a task. The bottom line is that it doesn’t matter how small or large your business is; you can streamline project workflow and reduce time-consuming tasks. Over time, this will save money.
9 Things Gym Management Systems Can Do For You
Modern gym management systems may exceed what you will actually need, which is why it’s essential to know your objectives before searching for the software you’ll choose. By having a clear picture of what you want and can achieve through gym management software, you can find the best solution for your needs that will benefit multiple areas of the business.
1. Member Management
A key objective of gym management systems is to simplify the entire member management process. The bloodline of any health club is a happy and sustained membership base. You can break the objective of member management into two categories: acquisition and retention. Gym management software should help you both market your business to new gym members and retain those you already have. Using gym software for member management will simplify all aspects of the process, such as check-ins, online registration, payments, and database management.

2. Gym Scheduling and Class Bookings
You should be able to easily schedule classes and manage all bookings and any other events you’re hosting. A gym management system should link class bookings to your client-facing app so that your members can manage their classes and book time slots with their favorite instructors both online and offline. When investing in gym software or upgrading your existing system, this is a non-negotiable feature that will add to your value offering. Over time, it increases your member retention and attracts more customers who expect flexibility and complete convenience.

3. Manage Billing
Managing a gym tends to involve a ton of administrative tasks like contracts, invoices, billing, membership cancellations, and payments. Gym management software should consolidate all billing management into one location. When you can see an overview of your gym’s finances, it can ease stress and save money in the long term. Finding out how to get the most out of your gym management software will mean that you can use it throughout the member journey. It will help cover everything from creating and signing contracts to automated billing and membership renewal reminders. A key objective of this type of software is to ease the workload on your team so they can focus their efforts on your members rather than being tied up in administrative tasks.

4. Member Retention
The right gym membership software solution will provide powerful tools to engage members and increase retention. By automating communication and interacting with members regularly, it increases the overall customer experience. Think about how you want to engage with your members; whether it’s push notifications as a reminder to get into the studio or automated email promotions, you want to choose membership management that aligns with your goals. The examples above, such as email automation, push notifications, and member activity tracking, are crucial as they enable you to:
Monitor member data and activity so that you can step in and engage with at-risk members before they leave.
Reduce member churn while boosting the overall customer experience.
Consistently engage members by getting in front of them – even when they’re not at the gym.

5. Email Marketing
By using your gym management system for
email marketing
, you can keep clients engaged. Automation and personalization are key to increasing engagement while at the same time easing the number of resources you need to run email campaigns. Segment your audience and target your email list with content that is relevant and valuable. You can create monthly newsletters, nurture campaigns, or send out quick updates whenever you need to inform your members of your latest news.

6. Data-Driven Decision Making
A modern business needs to make data-driven decisions. If you want to succeed in the digital era, leverage your data. You have never had access to more data than you do right now. When organizations realize the full power of data, they can make better decisions every day. That means increased efficiency, speed, and quality of service. Collecting, understanding, and reporting data are all very different stages. You can’t justify a higher budget or readjust your class schedule if you don’t understand the data. That’s why it’s important that the proposed system can provide reports across the business in an easy-to-digest format.

7. Financial Insights
To make well-informed financial decisions, you need to know the inner workings of your business. A gym management system can offer you financial insights by producing reports and tracking your cash flow. It’s essential that you know how much money is coming in and out of your business, whether that’s monitoring multiple revenue streams or knowing the recurring revenue coming in every month. No need to compare confusing spreadsheets using a manual system; your management software should produce clear reports that allow you to track all transactions easily. When you have access to better insights, it takes the guesswork out of a lot of decisions. You’ll have the information you need to make the best decisions for the business and drive growth.

8. Improve Member Experience
An incredible
member experience
is an essential part of running a successful fitness business. You could have great equipment and an impressive facility, but it’s your member experience that will set you apart from the competition. It’s what makes your business unique and retains members over time. To create the best experience possible, it’s important to streamline the customer journey and empower your members. That means booking, paying, and interacting with your brand should be as easy as possible. Members need to be able to book classes, pay for memberships and manage their gym schedule. Without this, the member experience will suffer. Nowadays, consumers expect a tech solution to streamline the ongoing relationship with your business.
Improve Your Member Experience
9. Reduce Costs
Putting your time and resources into the right part of the business can reduce time-wasting and costs. Administrative tasks take up a lot of time for gym owners and managers. A gym management system should free up a lot of time so that your team can focus on what they do best; selling gym memberships, creating a great member experience, and producing fantastic member results. When you make decisions driven by data, you will likely invest your money and time much more effectively.
The Fitness Founders Podcast has an interesting episode on
the new rules of engagement for the fitness industry
. Ian Mullane, the CEO of Keepme, talks about how data-driven personalization can increase member retention and the importance of consistency in the member journey.

How to Choose the Right Gym Management Software for Your Business
Depending on your type of business, you may have different objectives for a gym management system. Fitness software solutions tend to include a range of features. To choose the right management system, you need to align your objectives with the features. By investing in a new system that supports your business goals, you can streamline business operations and grow your membership base.

Mobile App Integration
Mobile app integration is an essential feature to look for in your gym management software. This allows members to book classes, make payments, and manage their membership through the app. The mobile app is an important feature to have alongside your online and website portal. This gives members the option to choose the booking feature that they use the most. Older generations may prefer to book online or in person, while younger members may only use your app. Think about features like app self-check-in services and app store integration to improve the member experience. Mobile apps should work on various operating systems and devices like Android, iPhone, and Windows.
Want Your Own Branded App?
Automated Services
Automation is suitable for both marketing and member retention. Use automation to welcome new members, send class booking reminders, and encourage inactive members to book classes. Automation helps to keep your members engaged without using your team’s time and resources. You can automate emails and push notifications to keep members updated. Automation tends to work by setting up certain behavior triggers. For example, when a new member signs up to your digital fitness platform, they would receive a welcome email and even a short how-to video on what to expect from their first class.

Point of Sale and E-commerce
Think about point of sale and e-commerce features. You need a fully customizable point of sale that suits your needs. Members are likely to make payments in-app, online, and in-person. If you’re selling digital memberships, online workshops, and branded merchandise, you need a system that features substantial point-of-sale features that support your business. Your point of sale should be designed around your members. If the majority of members book and pay through your app, you should have a system in place that makes the process as seamless as possible. A user-friendly payment process is essential for meeting member expectations.
Simplify Your Payments
Accessibility
When choosing a gym management system, you will need to think about accessibility. This includes whether you can access the system online, offline, or a combination of the two. Can you access member management through a website and mobile? Some fitness software solutions don’t include custom-branded mobile apps or it’s an added cost. You want to maximize accessibility for staff and members. It should be easy to make a booking as a member as well as produce a financial report as a manager.
Simplify Your Accessibility
Marketing Components
The main objective of gym management software is to save time, money, and resources. Look for marketing features like email marketing, automation, lead capture tools, Facebook Pixel and social media integration, and a booking system. Marketing capabilities are a big driver for purchasing gym management software. It can form a large part of your member acquisition and marketing strategy. You can utilize marketing features within your software to save time while increasing brand awareness and marketing your business efficiently.
Want to Double Your Leads?
Scheduling Features
Scheduling features are essential. By combining accessibility with scheduling features, you should find a software solution that allows members to book classes from various devices. Your software choice should make your life easier. Scheduling is a big consideration when choosing gym management software. The scheduling platform should include a simple user interface, and be easy to access in-person, online, and in-app. It should offer customization to include different times, classes, and instructors and flexible payment functionality.
Get Your Booking System
In Summary
It’s important to align your objectives to your fitness software solutions. Investing in a gym management system or upgrading your current system is a large expense and should entirely match your business goals and mission. The right member management software streamlines your business and allows your gym to grow efficiently. By using a solution that is completely accessible and features scheduling, marketing, and automated capabilities, you can find a product that is perfectly aligned with your business.

Now, as vaccine rollout begins in various parts of the world, there is a light at the end of the tunnel: at some point this year, gyms will be able to reopen and hopefully, this time, stay open.
But as we know, the pandemic has totally changed consumer expectations for the future. And when it comes to fitness, a
hybrid offering is, and will continue to be, normal.
Whether live or on-demand, online fitness classes have presented fitness businesses with a unique opportunity to reach a previously untapped audience.
With this, it’s clear that while moving online may have been a matter of survival through 2020, continuing to provide an exceptional member experience online, even long after the pandemic, is the key to long-term success for gyms and fitness studios.
Online fitness is now hugely competitive; there are thousands of options to choose from. But every member is different, so each class can offer a unique appeal.
The gyms of the future are
building communities
, delivering great workouts, and providing an exceptional member experience – both in-person and online. Here, we’ve curated a list of some of the best online fitness classes out there. Each brand stands out in one area particularly well, and there’s something you can learn from each of them.

4 Fitness Businesses Standing Out From the Competition With Online Classes
From
HIIT
and dance cardio to yoga and spin, the online fitness scene is now hugely diverse, and the flexibility and convenience of online workouts mean more and more people are choosing to try a variety of different classes to mix up their exercise routine.
Every workout has its own appeal and advantages, but as we know by now, when it comes to long-term retention, it’s accountability, the relationship you build with members, and experience that will set your business apart from competitors.
Below, we’ve picked out some excellent examples of fitness businesses succeeding online and the key takeaways for success from each one that you can apply to your own gym.
1. The Squad
Website:
https://thesquad.ie/
Classes offered:
Live group workouts
Get inspired by:
Their tight-knit and community and growing brand awareness.
The Squad is a gym and fitness center in Cork, Ireland that offers personal training and group fitness classes. Online classes are 40 minutes long, with various class packs and membership options available. Single online classes start from just over $9, and those new to The Squad can sign up for a free trial class.
The brand has survived and thrived online in recent months with its community of loyal, happy members. The workouts are carefully curated to push members through their paces; instructors will offer up modifications and hold joiners accountable during a live class, and call out the team’s efforts on social media afterward.
Aside from ensuring that each live class is energetic and motivating, the key areas you can take inspiration from The Squad go beyond offering great workouts. With almost 8,000 followers on Instagram, The Squad has an engaged membership base and a loyal following on social media. Owners Kate and Josie have built more than a fitness business: they’ve built a brand. Below are a few simple tips you can implement as part of your marketing strategy to reach and appeal to a wider audience and engage your community:
Key Takeaways from The Squad
Make your members a central focus in your marketing strategy
. The Squad builds brand awareness through social media with their online community, encouraging members to share their experience with photos and stories using the hashtag #ImWithTheSquad.
Be authentic and engaging on social.
Their online tone is conversational. Of course, they promote the business and push for signups with the regular posts and stories they share – but their content isn’t
solely
focused on selling classes. They’re engaging with their audience and building relationships.
Experiment with the type of content you share to find what aligns best with your goals.
During last year’s lockdown, the brand uploaded a weekly workout to its IGTV channel. Each video has received thousands of views, and it’s an excellent way to give potential members an insight into what to expect from a class and the instructors behind the business. Get creative to find what works for your business and your audience!

Fitness Blender is an on-demand workout platform, delivering hundreds of online workouts for people of all levels of fitness. Founded in 2009 today, the digital fitness provider has over 6.5 Million subscribers on YouTube. More than 600 of the workouts are free to everyone, and paying members can gain access to regular challenges, recipes, and meal plans.
Like many of the now household fitness names, including Peloton and Beach Body, Fitness Blenders’ wide range of workouts have grown more popular through the various lockdowns we’ve encountered over the last year.
Pricing and packaging varies, along with the access members, gain to certain types of content. The brand breaks down its options in a way that provides great value for members at every level, from free memberships to paid with options to purchase special meal plans and 4-week workout programs as add-ons. Without any program upsell packages, paid memberships start from $8.99 a month on an auto-renew subscription, $79.99 yearly, or pay as you go from $11.99 a month.
Key Takeaways from Fitness Blender:
Implement a ‘something for everyone’ structure to your workouts and pricing.
In the 11 years it’s been running, Fitness Blender has always been an only-only fitness provider, so they’ve had a lot of time to nail down their offering and pricing structure. Their offering caters to all levels of fitness, at all price points: even the free workouts are graded at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. Plus, there’s a wide choice of workouts varying in length – squeeze a 20-minute session in at lunch, or go all-in for 60 minutes when you have more time.
Focus on quality and value.
The impressive catalog of workouts for free members delivers great value, and it’s a great way to incentivize people to buy into a paid membership. We’re not saying you need 600 free on-demand workouts to appeal to potential members, but it’s a good idea to focus on offering value at every level.
Ensure your on-demand workouts are easy to follow.
The fitness instructor leading your pre-recorded workout video is showcasing a routine they’ve planned and are familiar with, but a member may be trying the routine for the first time. Each Fitness Blender workout video has a clear structure that’s explained at the beginning and is easy to follow throughout. There’s no jumping from one exercise straight into another without preparing the viewer for the next move. Your instructors shouldn’t come across as if they’ve just recorded themselves doing a workout; they need to keep the audience in front of mind to keep them engaged to the end.

3. Peloton
Website:
https://www.fitnessblender.com/
Classes offered:
Live and on-demand
Get inspired by:
Their personalized, motivating live classes
Digital fitness has been on the rise long before the pandemic, but with its acceleration over the last year, Peloton has become a brand that needs no introduction.
Most famously known for it’s $2,500 spin bike and accompanying live and pre-recorded classes, the brand has branched out with its digital services to offer a range of general home fitness workouts – no bike necessary. The company’s main money-maker comes from its monthly subscription service with users paying so they can take part in classes – owning the bike alone doesn’t grant you access to this.
Aside from the Peloton bike (and the brand’s more recent addition of its
Treadmil
) Peloton is known for delivering a hyper-personalized and motivating live class experience, which is something all fitness business owners can implement.
Key Takeaways from Peloton
Make your live class experience a personalized one.
The more personal the experience, the more your members feel included and like they’re a part of your community. The key message here is that personalization will help you build community, in turn fostering loyalty and increasing retention – your live classes need to make members feel like they’re a part of something to keep them coming back for more.
Call out members during a live class.
During live classes, Peoloton instructors use the data being tracked through riders bikes and online profiles to give shoutouts for performance milestones, efforts, and birthdays. It adds a personal touch to the experience, and makes members feel important – and you don’t need live data to do it. Your trainers can
see
who’s giving it 100% and deserves a shoutout, they can
see
people who are struggling and offer up some words of support. They likely see a lot of the same faces on a weekly basis, your team should understand that part of delivering a great live experience is making the effort to build a relationship with members.
4. Turf Games
Website:
https://turfgames.com/blogs/news/home-games-4-0-all-you-need-to-know
Classes offered:
Live and on-demand
Get inspired by:
The competitive element that keeps members engaged and motivated
The Turf games focuses on the social and competitive side of exercise. There are few widely-known opportunities to be challenged in a competitive fitness environment, so in 2017 the brand was created to cater to a gap in the fitness market for an inclusive competitive functional fitness event.The competitive element keeps members engaged and motivated, something that the brand has recreated effortless since moving online with its series of ‘Home Games.’
Home Games offers members of all fitness levels the chance to take part in a virtual competition with 5 workouts that are revealed across 2 weeks. Progress is tracked by members logging their scores on the virtual leaderboard, and members are incentivized by prizes from the brands sponsors including Blk Blok, Optimum Nutrition, and Under Armour.
While you don’t have to partner up with big-name brands to incentivize members, fitness challenges are an excellent way to keep motivation high and deliver a great experience – and that’s what stands out about the Turf Games.
Key Takeaways from Turf Games
If you’re not running online challenges – you could be missing out.
A fitness challenge is a great way to bring all of your members together. If you’re already running challenges, maybe it’s time to kick them up a notch. Experiment with a new challenge, new incentives, or new structure to excite and engage members.
Research what will work for your members.
Whether it’s a quick poll on social media or reaching out to members via email asking for their input: What type of challenge would they find most motivating? Would they prefer a team-based or personal best competition? Doing this means you’ll like create something that has a better uptake, and it shows your members that their feedback and opinions are important to you.
In Summary
Whether live or on-demand, the majority of online workouts are much the same across every online offering. But the best online fitness classes go above and beyond workouts. It’s a combination of personalization, community, accountability, and value that make up a great fitness experience and create a reason for members to keep coming back.

Now’s a great time to join the club. The global fitness industry is booming—in 2025,
it’s worth over $87 billion and only projected to grow
.
For many entrepreneurs, franchising is a faster way into the market.
And we’re guessing that as a fitness mover and shaker, your favorite speed is
fast
.
Naturally, you’ve got questions—starting with how to open a gym franchise step by step. Second, how much does it cost to open a gym franchise, anyway?
The good news? Franchises come with
built-in brand recognition, proven business models, and ongoing support.
You can imagine how valuable these tools are when starting a fitness business in a competitive market.
Whether you’re a fitness pro or new to the industry, this guide will take you through launching a successful gym franchise with confidence.
Let’s get started!
Pros and Cons of Franchising a Gym in 2025
Before diving into how much to open gym franchise locations or whether it’s the right move, it’s smart to weigh the pros and cons.
Franchising isn’t for everyone
—but it can be a smart way to launch a gym business with the backing of an established brand and a proven playbook.
PROS of starting a fitness franchise ✅
→ Built-in brand recognition
When you join a well-known fitness franchise,
you’re not starting from scratch
. When they hand over the keys, they also hand over
marketing know-how,
customer trust, and name recognition. Brands like
F45
and
Orangetheory
have already done the hard work of building consumer awareness so you don’t have to.
→ Proven business model
You’ll gain access to
established processes, systems,
and
tools
. Operations manuals, marketing templates, and sales scripts are part of the deal, saving you time and guesswork every single day.
→ Ongoing support
Most gym franchises offer
initial training, ongoing mentorship,
and
dedicated franchisee support
. You don’t have to navigate gym ownership alone, especially when it comes to staffing, software, compliance, and scaling.
→ Easier access to financing
Banks and lenders often view franchises as
lower-risk investments
compared to independent startups. That makes it easier to secure funding, especially if the franchise has a strong track record.
→ Faster time to launch
Franchisees often
open their doors faster
than independent gym owners. With fewer decisions to make from scratch, you can move from signing to opening in months—not years.
CONS of franchising a gym ❌
→ High startup costs
Wondering how much it costs to open a gym franchise? It varies. According to
Entrepreneur’s Franchise 500 listings
, some smaller fitness franchises start at $100,000, while larger brands can cost upwards of $500,000. These costs include franchise fees, build-out, equipment, and staffing… All expenses that add up.
→ Ongoing fees
Most franchises charge
monthly royalties
(usually a percentage of revenue) plus
marketing
and
tech fees
. While these payments cover brand support, they also eat into your profit margins.
→ Less flexibility
Want to test a new class style or change up your brand? With a franchise,
you’ll need to follow the company’s guidelines
. That limits your ability to
personalize your gym
, or respond to local trends and member requests.
→ Territory restrictions
Some franchise agreements
limit your ability to open other locations
or
expand outside your assigned area
. Make sure to keep this in mind if you have
long-term growth plans.
→ Not all franchises are created equal
The best gym franchises to own have
strong support systems
and
healthy unit economics
. But others may lack adequate training or fail to deliver on marketing promises.
Do your research
and request detailed financial reports before signing on the dotted line.
7 Steps to Open a Gym Franchise
Opening a fitness franchise can be a rewarding path to gym ownership so long as you cover all your bases.
If you’ve just started looking into how to open a gym franchise, our guide will help you move forward with confidence.
#1: Research the market and choose a franchise brand
Start by researching demand in your local area
. Are people looking for strength training? Boutique group fitness? More affordable options? Use what you discover to choose the best fitness franchise for your goals and community. (
Pro tip
: Many current owners
recommend working in a gym franchise first
to learn the ropes before investing.)
Compare franchise models using directories like
Franchise Direct
or
Entrepreneur’s Franchise 500
. Look into:
Brand reputation
Target audience
Support and training
Required investment
Profit potential
Pro tip
: Shortlist a few options and request franchise disclosure documents (FDDs) to dig into the details.

Franchise fee

This is the upfront fee you pay to use the franchise’s brand, systems, and support.

essentials for your gym setup.

*
Note
: In addition to the fees listed above, most franchises insist on a certain amount of cash upfront as well as a minimum net worth before allowing you to open a location.
“Franchising is a smart, smart choice—it shortcuts a lot of the stuff we had to deal with when growing our brands on our own.
It’s a very appealing option for people who want to get into the fitness industry without starting from scratch.”
– Debra Strougo,
Row House
co-founder
#3: Create a franchise gym business plan
Even with a proven model, you’ll need
a solid
business plan
. This should outline:
Your target market
Competitive analysis
Startup and operating budget
Growth and marketing strategy
Revenue and expense projections
A clear business plan not only helps you stay organized—it’s essential when applying for financing.

#4: Secure a location
Work with your franchisor to
find and scout potential locations.
Ideal spots often have
:
High foot traffic or easy access
Nearby parking or transit
Space for equipment, classes, and locker rooms
Some fitness franchises ask for a certain square footage or visibility. Check your agreement before signing a lease.
#5: Sign the franchise agreement and permits
Once you’ve secured funding and a location, it’s time to sign the franchise agreement! Before doing so, consider
consulting a franchise attorney
to review the fine print.
You’ll also need to register your business, apply for licenses and insurance, and meet local health and safety regulations. Your franchisor may assist with some of this, but responsibilities vary by brand.
#6: Build out and prepare for launch
This is the fun part—
when your gym starts taking shape
! Depending on your franchise, this phase might include:
Construction and design (based on brand standards)
Installing fitness equipment
Setting up gym management software
Hiring and training staff
Pre-launch marketing and lead generation
Pro tip
: Lean on your franchisor’s gym franchise startup checklist to help you avoid costly mistakes.
#7: Launch and grow!
Once your gym opens its doors, it’s time to focus on what you do best:
build community
,
nail retention
, and
generate revenue
.
And remember, your franchisor is there to support you. Let them handle national marketing campaigns, staff training, and performance benchmarks.
Track your KPIs (
key performance indicators
) from day one. Three things you’ll want to watch:
member sign-ups
,
retention rate
, and
monthly recurring revenue
.
With the right systems in place, you’ll be ready to grow your gym and open new locations in the future.
(And maybe even franchise your own gym!)

According to Straits Research, the global Pilates and yoga studio market was valued at $152.3 billion in 2023, and it’s projected to reach $377.1 billion by 2032.
And, with boutique fitness on the rise and a growing demand for low-impact strength training,
Pilates
has become a staple in wellness routines. But, while the practice may look effortless, opening a Pilates studio involves strategy, structure, and the right tools.
Here’s your updated, step-by-step guide to opening a Pilates studio that’s profitable and sustainable.
#1: Define Your Vision and Business Model
First, start by painting a clear picture of the kind of Pilates studio you want to create. Do you envision a boutique, mat-only space? A high-end studio filled with reformers and towers? Or a
hybrid model
offering both in-studio and virtual classes?
Defining your business model helps you make aligned decisions around everything from pricing to
marketing
. Consider what type of clients you want to serve. Are they beginners? Athletes? Postnatal women? Retirees? The more specific your niche, the easier it will be to attract your ideal audience and stand out in a crowded wellness market.
#2: Build a Rock-Solid Business Plan
Next, your
business plan
is your roadmap, especially in the early stages. It doesn’t need to be 100 pages long, but it should answer key questions: What is your mission? What services will you offer? How will you make money? Who are your competitors? What are your projected expenses and revenue in year one?
A solid business plan is also critical if you’re seeking investors, applying for loans, or negotiating a lease. And, it signals that you’ve done your homework and are building a real business—not just following a passion.

#3: Choose the Right Location
Location
is often the difference between a thriving studio and one that struggles to break even. Look for high-traffic areas near your ideal clients—like wellness hubs, residential neighborhoods, or commercial districts. So, ensure there’s ample parking or public transit options.
Also consider the space itself. Does it have good lighting? High ceilings for reformer work? Can it be soundproofed to create a serene environment? And don’t forget zoning—your location needs to be approved for fitness-related use.
#4: Budget for Equipment and Startup Costs
Next, opening a Pilates studio isn’t cheap, but planning ahead helps avoid surprises. And,
equipment
is one of your biggest investments. Reformers alone can range from $3,000 to $6,000 each. Other essentials include towers, chairs, springboards, mats, mirrors, and props like rings and resistance bands.
Then there’s the studio build-out: flooring, lighting, HVAC, sound system, signage, and decor. Plus licenses, insurance, software, instructor salaries, and marketing. According to Wod.Guru, many studios open with budgets between $50,000–$100,000+. So, keep that in mind as you build your
business plan
.
#5: Hire Qualified and Inspiring Instructors
Next, instructors are the face of your brand. They build relationships, drive retention, and shape your studio culture. And, hiring qualified instructors with
comprehensive Pilates certification
is non-negotiable. But, also look for people with strong communication skills and the ability to adapt to different body types and abilities.
Pro tip:
It’s also worth considering instructor development programs or mentorships to help your staff grow and stay loyal. Great instructors want to keep learning—and the more invested they feel, the more likely they are to stick around.
#6: Create an Irresistible Client Experience
Your studio should feel like a second home to your clients. And that’s why from the moment they walk in, every touchpoint matters: the scent in the air, the playlist in the background, how they’re greeted, and how easy it is to book their next class.
Think beyond the workout itself. How are you
onboarding new clients
? What kind of community are you building? Do you offer challenges, workshops, or small group series? Exceptional client experience turns occasional visitors into raving fans—and long-term members.

Opening a Gym or
Studio

#7: Market Like a Pro (Even If You’re New)
Next,
marketing
doesn’t have to be complicated, but it does need to be consistent. Start with the basics: a clean website, an active Instagram account, and a Google Business profile. Use photos and testimonials from real clients to build trust.
And, don’t forget to consider referral programs, pop-up classes at local events, or collaborations with wellness brands. Finally, build an email list before you open so you can start generating buzz. And remember: people don’t just buy classes—they buy energy, community, and transformation.
#8: Use Studio Management Software from Day One
Spreadsheets will only take you so far. Software like ABC Glofox gives you the ability to manage your entire business from one dashboard: scheduling, payments, client messaging, progress tracking, and analytics.
That’s why starting with
studio management software
from the beginning helps you scale more efficiently. Not to mention the fact that it also offers a more seamless client experience—letting members book classes, manage memberships, and track progress right from their phones.

#9: Focus on Retention, Not Just Acquisition
Finally, getting clients in the door is important—
but keeping them is where you build true profitability
. Create a client journey map: what happens in their first class, their first month, their first year? What are the milestones and celebrations?
Use tools like ABC Glofox to monitor attendance patterns and flag drop-offs. Offer personalized check-ins, loyalty rewards, and flexible membership options. When clients feel seen and supported, they stick around—and they bring their friends.

FAQ: What People Want to Know Before Opening a Pilates Studio
How much does it cost to open a Pilates studio?
Expect to invest between $50,000 to $100,000 for a boutique studio. Costs depend on location, equipment, and build-out. High-end spaces can exceed $200,000.
Is a Pilates studio profitable?
Yes! A well-run Pilates studio can earn solid returns with profit margins typically ranging between 5%–30%. Profitability depends on rent, class capacity, retention, and pricing model.

What is the 80/20 rule in Pilates?
The 80/20 rule in fitness usually means that 80% of results come from 20% of effort—often referring to the importance of consistency over intensity. In Pilates, it can also refer to prioritizing foundational movement (80%) before layering in complexity (20%).
What do I need to start a Pilates business?
Here’s a quick checklist:
A clear
business model
and niche
Studio space in a good location
Certified instructors
High-quality Pilates equipment
Liability insurance and business registration
A marketing and launch plan
Studio software like ABC Glofox to manage it all

is one of the fitness industry’s most well-known resources for springboarding small businesses into wild success. He has coached celebrities, athletes, and everyone in between on how to improve their fitness journey. In recent years, however, he’s worked with a wide variety of fitness business owners to help them create sustainable, predictable income streams for their budding enterprises.
In this interview, Phil explains exactly where most fitness business owners go wrong and how a simple shift in mindset can help their future franchises flourish.
In scaling your fitness business, there is one thing to remember:
Money is not the end goal, it’s the means to get to the finish line.
Why Money is Not the Answer
“Most fitness business owners are great coaches but terrible business people”
It may be a sweeping statement, but it really is true. Many fitness business owners have incredible skills in helping their clients lead healthier and happier lives. They can create workout programs for any body type or need and show clear, actionable results. But, when it comes to their business, they often fall short.
Simple things such as sales and marketing can get left by the wayside because they’re focusing too strongly on the things that don’t matter. Instead of creating a predictable and scalable income stream, many first-time business owners will create an unrealistic and unsustainable business plan that leads to failure in the end.
So what’s the key?
Move away from money and focus on freedom.
From conversations with thousands of business owners, from small studios to major franchises, Phil has seen time and again that money doesn’t buy happiness, freedom does. If you can create a business model that creates a clear line of income that is repeatable month in, month out, you will be far happier than someone earning five times as much but needing to hustle every waking moment to make it.
So how do you create this freedom?
Selfish and Selfless: Find the Balance
“Don’t hold back from asking for money whenever you’re going to provide a service. But, the service must be a fair exchange for what you are providing to what you are charging.”
There is nothing more common in this world than fitness business owners underselling and overworking themselves.
Ask yourself this question:
Do you know someone in your area who’s charging more than you, but offering a worse service?
We all know the answer.
Take a deep look at your business model and analyze whether you’re undercharging for your expertise. It’s not just your fees that you need to look at – are you doing too much for your clients? Spending hours on programs that you know they’re not going to appreciate?
Be more selfish with your time and how you charge for it. In the end, you’ll start noticing that your clients will start valuing your time more because of it.
But how do you know when you’re charging too much?
You’ll know when you feel like your clients aren’t getting enough gains out of their investment.
Think about your business this way: your clients are giving you money as an investment, saying that time spent with you will lead to a healthier and fitter body. There’s a price on that investment, for everyone. Once it feels like you’re no longer providing the experience that your clients are investing in, it may be time to either lower your prices or increase the quality of your services.
So let’s say you have an excellent pricing model that leads to predictable income and peace of mind – now what?
Learn How to Improve Yourself
As a fitness business owner, you are the product. Your fitness program is what people are paying for. You are at the center of the web, being the key stakeholder for every single decision you make.
If you’re not improving, your business won’t improve.
If you’re currently earning $2-4k a month and want to boost that up to $15 or $20k, you need to focus on you, what you contribute to the business, and how you can improve it overall. As Phil says, “you can’t build an inspiring life without asking for help”.
Look to your local community, other fitness business owners, courses, and any and all other material you can find that might help you become a better business owner.
Finally, and most importantly:
If you don’t have a mission, you’ll most likely fail.
If you’re coming into work every day just for the money, you will get burnt out and you will lose your enthusiasm for every aspect of the business.
If you’re working towards a goal, however, you’ll be able to work better, harder, and more efficiently than ever. Ask yourself
why
you’re building this business. Is it to help yourself? To help others? The community? Take some time to really understand what your motivators are and how you can achieve those goals. Once you have those, you’ll see a dramatic change in your business’ health.

The 10 Barriers Slowing Your Business Growth
Confront Your Problems to Find the Solutions
Every fitness business has problems – it’s the nature of business. There is always something to improve in marketing, sales, onboarding, equipment, staff and every other element of running a business.
But these problems are usually a symptom of a deeper root cause. Usually, it’s either due to a lack of education or a lack of motivation. Changing your business mindset to see yourself as the project to improve solves both of these problems.
No matter what stage you’re at in your business journey, take some time now to visualize where you want to be in a year, in five years, and in ten years. Do you actually know how you’ll get there or achieve it? What are the accelerators that lead you to those goals? Are they realistic? You need to realize that mindset and goal setting are the keys to creating a successful business. When you have the eagerness and energy to learn, change, and grow, you will eventually see success as a fitness business owner.

Business Scaling for Fitness – Your Next Steps
5 Steps to Expand Your Fitness Business Internationally
Step #1 – Define your new market opportunities
Before you commit resources to scaling a business, get crystal clear on where you’re headed and why.
Business growth strategies
start with identifying the
right
opportunities, not just the ones that seem exciting on paper.
There are two main paths you can take:
geographic expansion
or
demographic expansion
.
Geographic expansion means entering new cities, regions, or countries where your brand doesn’t currently exist.
Demographic expansion focuses on reaching new member segments—like
targeting Gen Z members
when your current base skews older, or entering the corporate wellness space.
Both approaches require understanding demand and trends in your target market. What’s trendy in the industry today? What gaps exist in your current offerings? The research process is similar whether you’re opening in a new neighborhood or a new nation—though the stakes and complexity increase significantly when crossing borders. Smart business scaling strategies account for these differences early.

Step #2 – Research and test the market before committing
Once you’ve identified potential markets, test your assumptions before signing a lease. Local market research is essential when business scaling takes you beyond your home territory—whether that’s a new city or a new country.
Start by understanding the basics
: What does local fitness culture look like? What regulations surround gym operations? Who are your competitors, and what’s their pricing structure? Even moving from one U.S. city to another can bring surprising differences in member preferences, whereas international expansion adds complex new layers of language,
currency
, and regulatory complexity.
Second, test your concept with
lower-risk pilots
. Consider
pop-up classes
, digital-first rollouts with virtual programming, or partnerships with local influencers. These pilot programs give you real data without the commitment of a long-term lease or tons of capital.
Step #3 – Adapt your brand and offerings for local relevance
What resonates with members in one region might fall flat in another—even within the same country.
For example, are HIIT classes popular in this market, or do members prefer
yoga and mindfulness
? A 6 AM boot camp might be perfect in New York but could struggle in a city where members prefer evening workouts.
Your
marketing messages
also need
localization
. Direct, high-energy messaging might work well in some U.S. markets, but could feel too aggressive in certain European or Asian markets—or even in more laid-back domestic cities. Collaborate with local marketing talent who understand the nuances of language and cultural context.
Even
your pricing and membership models
may need adjustment. Month-to-month memberships might be the norm in your home market, but annual contracts could be #1 elsewhere. The key is to stay flexible while being true to your
brand
.

Step #4 – Build tech and ops foundations for global growth
When scaling to new markets, your technology needs to work wherever you go. If your
franchise management software
can’t handle
regional payment preferences
,
different languages
, or
varied regulatory requirements
, you’ll hit roadblocks fast. This is where fitness scaling gets technical—but it’s essential to get it right the first time!
For
domestic expansion
, you need
consistent systems
that work across locations. For i
nternational growth
, the requirements intensify. Your member management software should support multi-currency billing, multiple languages, regional payment preferences (SEPA in Europe, digital wallets in Asia), and compliance with local data privacy regulations.
Beyond payments, think about your
operational infrastructure
when expanding operations. How will you manage teams across time zones? How do you ensure training consistency when your staff is spread across regions or continents?
This is where the right software helps you with scaling a business. ABC Glofox offers international payment capabilities, support for 17+ languages in 100+ markets, and centralized reporting across multiple locations—so you can maintain control while giving regional teams the flexibility they need.

Step #5 – Track metrics that matter across markets
When expanding operations, your reporting needs become more sophisticated. You can’t just look at overall revenue; you need to understand
performance at the market level
.
You’ll want to track retention rates by market to see which locations are keeping members engaged long-term.
It’s also useful to compare cost of acquisition across regions to identify where your marketing spend is most efficient.
Finally, calculating member lifetime value by market will help understand which segments are most profitable. This matters whether you’re comparing Dallas and Denver or London and Los Angeles.
Engagement metrics
matter, too. Are members in certain markets booking more classes per month? Are they responding better to SMS versus email? Are they using your
branded app
more actively? Detailed metrics help you make smarter decisions about where to invest next.

How Community Engagement Fuels Growth (and How to Measure It)
FAQs – Scaling a Business
How do I scale my fitness business internationally?
First things first: you’ll need to define clear market opportunities and conduct thorough research into local culture, regulations, and competition.
Here’s how:
→ Test your concept with pilot programs before committing to a full launch
→ Adapt your brand messaging for local relevance while maintaining its consistency at the core
→ Build tech infrastructure that supports multi-currency billing and multilingual apps
→ Track market-specific KPIs to make data-driven decisions
The same basic principles apply whether you’re expanding to a nearby city or across international borders.
What’s the best way to expand a business across multiple markets?
The best approach combines careful planning with flexible execution.
Don’t uncritically replicate your existing model
. Instead, understand what makes each market unique and adapt accordingly.
Next, you’ll want to invest in technology that scales with you. The best
franchise management software
handles regional preferences, multi-currency, multiple languages, and centralized reporting.
Again, you’ll want to start with pilot programs to test assumptions before making any major commitments. It’s much cheaper to learn during a three-month pilot than after signing a five-year lease.
How can fitness studios adapt to new demographics like Gen Z?
Gen Z members have different expectations, period. They want things like:
Easy digital experiences for
booking classes
and tracking progress
Authentic brand values around sustainability, mental health, and inclusivity
Flexible membership options instead of rigid long-term commitments
Video-first social content on TikTok and Instagram showing real workouts and BTS content, not overly polished posts

What challenges come with scaling a business globally?
Fitness scaling across borders introduces complexity at every level. You’ll face
different regulations
for employment, contracts, data privacy, and consumer protection.
Payment methods
vary by region; what works in North America won’t necessarily work in Europe or Asia.
Cultural differences
affect everything from marketing to programming. That high-energy, competitive vibe that works in your U.S. locations might not translate to markets where wellness is approached more holistically.
Expect to be tested. Managing
distributed teams
across time zones
requires strong processes. Plus, balancing brand consistency while allowing for local adaptation takes practice.
How do I keep brand consistency while expanding into new markets?
Brand consistency starts with understanding what’s core versus what’s flexible. Your core values,
visual identity
, and brand promise should stay the same, always. But execution (tone of voice, class offerings, and pricing) can certainly adapt to local markets.
Use
brand guidelines
that give regional teams structure while allowing customization. Invest in
centralized systems
that enforce consistency where it matters—like billing processes—while giving local teams autonomy in programming and community building.
Business Scaling for Fitness – Your Next Steps
Scaling your fitness brand across multiple markets is one of the most exciting growth opportunities you’ll face—but it’s also challenging!
Whether you’re expanding to new cities or launching internationally, you’ll need strategic planning, deep market understanding, flexibility to adapt to each market, and the right operational infrastructure to make it all happen.
When done right, business scaling can transform your boutique studio or regional gym into a recognized brand or franchise with broader reach.

You’ve been working hard to get to this moment, after all!
Yet there are plenty of challenges that can come with scaling—such as
juggling multiple locations
, training new staff while maintaining service quality, and somehow trying to keep that coveted personal touch with a
growing member base
.
The difference between fitness studios that scale successfully and those that struggle often comes down to one critical factor:
the systems they have in place before they hit the growth phase.
User-friendly software isn’t just nice to have when scaling your studio. It provides
the necessary infrastructure
that makes growth possible without sacrificing what made your business special in the first place.
The right platform
streamlines operations
,
maintains a consistent experience
across locations, and
automates tedious tasks
that would otherwise multiply as you expand.
Let’s explore why user-friendly software is your secret weapon for scaling your business with fewer growing pains.

Why Many Fitness Studios Fail When Scaling (The Timing Question)
Timing is everything when scaling your fitness business.
Expanding too early
is a common pitfall that can derail even the most promising studios.
Watch for warning signs you’re not ready: inconsistent profitability at your current location,
high staff turnover
, or manual processes that already feel overwhelming.
Growth will only amplify these issues.
Before expanding, ensure you have:
A stable core business with
predictable revenue
Sufficient cash reserves
to weather the transition
Clearly documented processes that don’t live solely in your head
Operational challenges
multiply quickly once you scale. Scheduling across locations becomes a puzzle,
inventory management
gets more complex, and maintaining consistent service quality can feel like an uphill battle.
This is where user-friendly software becomes critical—it sets the stage for growth before you’re stretched too thin. Moreover, this software automates the processes that would otherwise require twice the staff and three times the headaches.

The Top 10 Barriers Slowing Your Fitness Business Growth
Why Is Choosing the Right Software Critical When Scaling Your Business?
As your studio expands,
the software you choose
will largely determine whether you scale smoothly or get overwhelmed by the details.
Consider
payments across multiple locations
. Manually reconciling transactions from different studios quickly becomes laborious and error-prone, while an integrated platform can automatically handle this process for all your locations.
The
complexity of
class booking
grows with each new studio. Members want to easily book at any location, and you need accurate attendance tracking across the board. The right software creates a frictionless experience for everyone involved.
Staff
scheduling
across multiple sites
can quickly become a logistical challenge. Without proper systems, instructors might be accidentally double-booked, which creates frustration all-around.
These are just a few examples of where user-friendly software can make a difference.
Plus, studio owners consistently report
significant time savings
after implementing the right software—giving them more opportunities to focus on growth strategies and building lasting member relationships.

How Does User-Friendly Software Enhance Efficiency and Productivity?
#1: It saves time
For studio owners,
time is the most precious resource
—especially when managing multiple locations. User-friendly software eliminates hours of redundant work through automation and centralization.
Where you’ll notice the difference immediately:
Streamlined check-in process
Consider the
daily class check-in process
. Without integrated software, front desk staff at each location manually verify memberships, track attendance, and reconcile no-shows.
With intuitive software, this process becomes
completely automated
. Members simply scan in or are checked off digitally, attendance is recorded instantly, and
no-shows receive automatic follow-ups
.
In turn, your front desk staff are freed up to provide more attentive, personalized service to your members. It’s a win-win!
Simplified instructor scheduling
Software allows your instructors to set their availability once for all locations instead of juggling separate calendars for each location (or worse—manually confirming your instructors’ availability on a post-it note).
So when Sarah, one of your most popular yoga instructors, updates her availability,
the system automatically reflects these changes
across all relevant schedules and locations—no phone calls, text messages, or back-and-forth emails required.
📝

#2: It reduces mistakes
Even the most careful staff make errors. Unfortunately, these mistakes can multiply as you scale. Intuitive software
can reduce the likelihood of costly mistakes
through built-in safeguards and standardization.
Here’s how this plays out day-to-day:
Preventing scheduling conflicts
Double-bookings
can put a damper on the member experience. Without integrated software, it’s easy to accidentally schedule two classes in the same studio space.
Imagine your members arriving for an evening HIIT class only to find another class already in progress! Software prevents this situation by
alerting your team to conflicts
and maintaining a
single source of truth
for room availability across all locations.

Eliminating billing errors
Inaccurate billing hurts your revenue and your reputation with members. One staff member might charge someone who recently froze their membership or apply the wrong rate when a member visits a different location.
Integrated software
maintains accurate records across all locations
, which ensures that your members’ billing status is always correct—no matter if they visit you downtown or in the suburbs. This level of consistency is key to high member satisfaction.

#3: It increases operational efficiency
Beyond saving time and reducing errors, user-friendly software creates
operational gains
that wouldn’t otherwise be possible when managing multiple locations.
You’ll appreciate results from:
Streamlined sales process across locations
Managing leads becomes much easier with
an integrated CRM
. Without proper software, prospective members who inquire at one location might
slip through the cracks
if they visit another.
With the right system, your team can access
a complete history of every prospect’s interactions
—regardless of which location they visited first. Your team picks up right where they left off, creating a consistent experience that converts more prospects into members.
360° view of your entire ecosystem
Guessing which locations need support is risky business. Good software gives you
clear performance metrics
across all studios so you can
make informed decisions
.
Your dashboard might reveal that your newest location has strong membership growth but low retail sales, while your established space shows declining class attendance despite steady revenue. These insights let you
target your resources precisely where they’re needed
instead of applying one-size-fits-all solutions across your business.

Revenue insights that drive growth
Similarly, user-friendly software shows you
exactly
where your money comes from at each location. Perhaps your main studio generates more revenue from group classes, while your second location earns more from personal training.
These patterns help you play to
each location’s unique strengths
. You might expand studio space at your flagship location while adding private training rooms at your other studio.
In any case, you’ll be equipped to make smarter decisions backed by real data, not hunches or assumptions.
How Does User-Friendly Software Improve the Member Experience?
Great studio software makes your life easier and creates happier members who stick around longer. Here’s how the right technology helps you maintain that “small studio feel” even as you expand your business:
It personalizes the experience
Nothing feels worse than being treated like a stranger at a studio you’ve visited for months. Software helps your team
remember the little things that matter
.
So when Tim checks in at your new downtown location instead of his usual spot, your staff greets him by name. The system flags his upcoming birthday and notes he prefers early morning classes.
These
small personal touches
maintain the community feeling that made your first location successful.

It creates consistency across locations
Members expect the same great experience no matter which location they visit. Software helps ensure:
Class formats remain consistent
Instructors have access to member notes and preferences
Payment policies and scheduling rules stay uniform
The
check-in process
feels familiar everywhere
This consistency builds trust as members explore your different locations.
It keeps open lines of communication
During a growth phase,
keeping members informed
prevents frustration and builds excitement.
For instance, your software can
automatically notify members
about new locations, special events, or schedule changes. It
collects feedback
through automated surveys after visits, which helps you quickly identify and address issues before they affect retention.
So when Maya submits feedback about the temperature at your newest location, your team responds quickly and personally—making her feel valued and heard, no matter how large your business grows.
Key Features to Look for in User-Friendly Software
When evaluating software for your growing fitness business, focus on these essential features that make scaling smoother:
Powerful automation
eliminates manual work. Look for software that handles repetitive tasks like sending class reminders, processing payments, and following up with no-shows—all without your team having to lift a finger!
Helpful integrations
connect your entire business ecosystem. Your software should play nicely with the tools you already use, from payment processors to marketing platforms. This helps you avoid the headache of entering the same information multiple times or hunting for data across different platforms.
Easy access
means your team can manage operations from anywhere. Cloud-based solutions let you check in on any location from your phone while walking your dog, or approve payroll while waiting for your coffee. This flexibility becomes invaluable when overseeing multiple studios.
Simple, intuitive design
reduces training time when onboarding new staff. The best software feels natural to use. If your team needs constant retraining or struggles to complete basic tasks, expansion becomes unnecessarily difficult.
The right software helps you and your team work smarter, not harder—in turn making growth manageable rather than overwhelming.
FAQs: User-Friendly Software and Scaling Your Business
What does scaling your business mean?
Scaling means growing your business in a way that increases revenue without proportionally increasing costs. For fitness studios, this typically involves

the member experience

Unlike simply getting “bigger,” scaling creates
systems
that work efficiently regardless of size.
What are the best strategies for scaling a fitness studio?
The most successful studios focus on:
Systematizing operations
before expanding
Training teams thoroughly on standardized processes & procedures
Leveraging technology
to automate repetitive tasks

Video has increasingly become a “need to have” when it comes to marketing. The problem is that a lot of companies see it as a box-ticking exercise rather than a strategy that needs proper thought and investment.
“We need to start doing video. Can we get that going?” is the usual request from a studio owner to a confused member of staff or marketing intern.
The real questions you should be asking is:
Why
you want to do video
What
impact do you want it to have on your business
How
you are going to do it
And part of the answer to that last question is short form video content.
Why this topic matters:
Short form video content will explode in popularity over the next year on every major social media platform and most marketers are building their strategies around it – it’s crucial that you are thinking about short form video the same way.
What you’re going to learn:
In this article, you will learn what short form video content is, hear from Barry and Shay Kostabi from Fitness Career Mastery, look at the must have tools you need for short form video and lay out a playbook for short form video success.

What is short form video content?
According to marketing automation giants Hubspot, short form video is anything under 60 seconds. In an excellent
social media marketing report
overviewing the key stats and  trends around social media in 2023, they’ve hit on some insights on short form video content.
Here’s 3 key points from this research:
Funny content is the most popular among video marketers:
33% of the respondents surveyed said they would focus on funny content the most as this gets the best results.
Short form video is the most engaging:
The report found that short form video ranks for No.1 for lead generation and engagement
Short form video content leads the way on social media:
85% of marketers say that video is the most effective format on social media
Other prominent experts agree with the clear effectiveness of short form video, especially when it comes to things like podcasting. Renowned marketing expert Eric Siu recently posted on Linkedin about this very topic. In a post you can
find here
, Eric explains how short form video will be crucial for growing your businesses podcast in 2023 and beyond.
Eric says that you should “have interesting conversations with people, highlight the most interesting sections and post produce for short form video and watch the awareness of your podcast grow exponentially.”
Now we’ve looked at the ins and outs of short form video content, let’s look at the technical elements of what makes great short form video.
What the experts say: Barry and Shay Kostabi
“You’ve really got to develop your talent on camera, and you have to recognize that in the past, this is something that’s been cultivated over time. It’s not going to happen overnight. But you do need to invest in it”
Barry and Shay Kostabi are LA based fitness business experts who specialize in helping businesses grow their online presence and other aspects of their business. They host the
Fitness Career Mastery
podcast and have been welcome guests on our own podcast and the last two editions of our fitness conference.
In their
podcast interview with us
, the two go into detail about the best ways to film video content. While the focus is more on filming classes and instructional videos, they share some great tips that can be applied to your short form video content.
Here are three important insights from that interview:
Make sure you’ve a clean set and good lighting:
Your content doesn’t have to be shot on  the latest 4k cinema camera, but it does help to have a good quality camera on your phone. Make sure the video is lit well so you and your background can be clearly seen – a simple light ring should be enough.
Look at others for inspiration:
The best way to learn how to be the best is to look at the best. Follow a range of different fitness operators and experts who have large followings and see what they are doing on TikTok, Instagram Reels and Youtube Shorts. Look at how the video is shot, what they are saying and the copy and hashtags they use.
Pretend you are talking to just one person:
It can be daunting thinking that you are talking to loads of people.  Barry and Shay recommend that you imagine you are just speaking to one person, like a best friend, and this will calm your nerves and make you more focused.
In the next part of this article we are going to go through the must have tools you need to succeed with short form video.
5 short form video tools you need to have
When creating short form videos there’s a couple of basic things you need to have in your armory to be successful. It’s not as simple as putting on a camera and shouting action – there’s a few more pieces to the puzzle. Let’s go through them below.
Camera set-up
The camera is obviously the most important part of your set-up. However as we’ve said before there’s no point in investing in a digital camera unless you’re really experienced already. Most of the latest Android and Apple phones have pretty good cameras on them. Invest in a camera phone stand for stationary shots and a selfie stick for moving shots.

The 8 best cameras for filming sports and exercise
Editor and/or editing software
A lot of your short form videos might be specific moments from a longer podcast or instructional videos. You or the person in charge of your social media will probably take on the role of editor, as it would be a waste of money to hire someone initially for such simple edits. Free editing software like PowerDirector or iMovie usually work best – check out this
list of the best editing softwares here.
Lighting
As mentioned before by Barry and Shay, goog lighting is very important when shooting video. As with the camera and editing you don’t need to break the bank with lighting. Most content creators use
a lighting ring like this
. Natural light from a window can be used also to good effect if your camera phone is good quality.
Podcast mic
As we’ve mentioned a lot of your short form videos may be cuts of your longer podcast videos. Good, clear audio is so important. People will be forgiving if the video quality isn’t 100% but won’t stick around long if the audio is poor.

is the most widely used podcast mic by creators
Social media management platform
Once you’ve created your video and uploaded it, you need to track how your content is performing. The reason for this is that you can see what type of content performs best and what doesn’t perform. This helps you make better short form content going forward.
Sprout Social
and
Hootsuite
are two typical examples of the better social media management platforms.
The fitness studio operators short form video playbook
As we’ve seen from Hubspot’s 2022 social media report, short form video content will be the most effective type of social media content over the next couple of months and into the future. However, it’s one thing to say it will be effective and another to actually make it effective.
In this part of the article we are going to run through a step by step playbook to ensure you get  the best out of your short form video strategy. Let’s dive in.
Pick a person to front your short form content
The most important aspect of your video content is the person who fronts it. They are the star, the focal point and the face of the information you are giving out to the audience. As a fitness business owner, you are the person with all the knowledge, all the authority and the direction of your fitness studio ultimately lies with you.
So it makes sense that you front your content. You should be the podcast host and the face of your instructional videos. Ultimately you are the person people will likely trust the most as it’s you who knows how to help them achieve their goals. As your content grows you can then start to integrate members of your team.
Build a bank of long form content
What stops a lot of operators from fully getting on board with short form video content is the volume of content they think they have to produce every day/week/month. And while you should plan out single pieces of content to create, the better and more efficient strategy is to mostly create long form video content you can then cut up in short form pieces.
Here’s a couple of examples of some long form content you can cut up into smaller pieces.
A podcast/video interview series:
A long form podcast series where you interview experts or just talk about a topic yourself is a great source of short form content. Structure episodes to produce headline grabbing moments that will have a lot of impact.
Instructional/advice videos:
Unfortunately the fitness industry is full of bad information and people trying to make quick cash selling products, plans and workout programs that don’t work. Make long form videos on key topics around nutrition, exercise science and workout tips that are clear, factual and dispel industry myths and misconceptions.
Online classes:
Online classes exploded during the pandemic and while they are less popular now among brick and mortar studios they are still useful pieces of content. Go back over your old online classes and cut out sections where you demonstrate workouts, turning them into short, snappy workout tutorials.
Focus on these three types of content
When you’re starting out the first thing you’re probably thinking is “where do I start??” – this is a common fear a lot of fitness business owners struggle with at the start. Think of it this way though, you need to deliver information that will entertain, educate and engage your audience. Here are three types of content you should largely focus on when starting out.
Motivational content:
The biggest issue your members run into is typically around motivation. Getting up and getting to the gym to do a workout isn’t always easy so make content around giving people a “why” to encourage them to workout.
Instructional content:
The fitness industry can be a minefield of information so make clear, simple to follow instructional content around fitness and nutrition. Content like this also helps build up your authority in the fitness space.
Humorous content:
As we’ve seen in Hubspot’s report, 33% of marketers believe funny content will be the most effective short form video content going forward. People are on social media to be entertained at the end of the day so try not overload your video content with just instructional information.
A top tip for humorous content – make a list of typical problems people encounter in the gym (people taking over the machines, looking at themselves in the mirror) and use this as the basis to make your short form content funny and relatable.
Repurpose your content across different platforms
Your audience won’t just be on one platform typically and will be across a couple of different social media platforms. Therefore you shouldn’t focus on just one platform for your content. When creating a piece of short from content think about these points:
Focus on the three most popular platforms:
TikTok, Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels are the most widely used short form platforms. Adjust your hashtags, copy and length depending on the platform
Use organic as a testing ground for paid:
If you find a piece of short form organic content that is very successful, this could be a good indication it could do well on your paid advertising.
Always have a CTA at the end of your video
A key part of your video content is to have a call to action(CTA) at the end of your video. Remember that the main purpose of your video content is to get the attention of the person and get them to take action. Without the person taking an action, your content will fall into the ether.
When it comes to your CTA you’re not trying to sign up the person straight away. Short form video content falls under the category of top of funnel awareness content so the person who sees your video probably isn’t ready to sign up for a membership yet. So for now your CTA should be “If you want to see more of this helpful content, drop us a follow”
A top tip for CTAs – you should still always have a link to a lead capture form in your homepage bio to capture people who are ready to sign up now.
In summary
Short form video content has exploded in popularity and offers fitness studio owners an incredible opportunity to grow their social media pages organically.

Those days feel like a distant memory now that you’re managing people across multiple locations.
Staff management
becomes exponentially more complex as your fitness business grows—and it’s one of the biggest hurdles standing between you and successful
expansion
.
Here’s the reality:
more locations mean more people, and more people mean more moving parts
. Suddenly, you’re juggling HR responsibilities across different locations—and maybe even time zones.
The challenge isn’t just about having more staff. It’s about maintaining consistency, ensuring quality, and creating systems that work
whether you’re in the building or not
.
Staff management tools can help.
ABC Glofox
helps multi-location gym operators
enhance operational efficiency at scale
, including your workforce planning. Because when you’ve dialed in your staff management systems, expansion to new locations and regions becomes significantly easier.
Let’s get into it.

The Challenges of Managing Staff Across Multiple Gym Locations
Staff management multi locations brings unique obstacles that single-site operators never face. Here are the most common challenges that create operational headaches and can impact your bottom line:
Challenge #1 – Differences in staff availability and schedules
Coordinating staff schedules
across multiple locations quickly becomes a logistical nightmare. This is because each site has different peak hours, staffing needs, and employee availability.
Manual scheduling often results in
understaffing during busy periods
or
overstaffing during slow periods
.
Unfortunately, when coverage gaps occur, it’s common for remaining staff to get overwhelmed,  which leads to a drop in service quality. This is when members notice the difference in their experience.
Challenge #2 – Maintaining consistent brand standards across sites
Your flagship location might deliver
exceptional service
, but ensuring that same quality across all sites can be difficult.
Staff at different locations interpret training differently, apply policies inconsistently, and may develop their own “way of doing things.” This creates a fragmented
member experience
where the
service quality varies dramatically
depending on which location they visit, which could potentially damage your brand’s reputation.
Challenge #3 – Communication breakdowns between locations
Critical information frequently gets
lost in translation between sites
. Policy updates, promotional changes, and
operational procedures
don’t reach everyone in the same way, at the same time.
Some locations operate with outdated information, while others implement changes incorrectly. These
communication gaps
create confusion among staff, lead to operational errors, and result in members receiving conflicting information about your services, pricing, and/or policies.

Challenge #4 – Tracking performance fairly and effectively
Evaluating staff performance becomes nearly impossible if you’re relying on
manual systems across multiple locations
. Different managers may have varying standards, which makes fair comparisons difficult.
It’s difficult to identify
top performers for recognition
, or struggling employees who need additional training, without centralized tracking. This lack of visibility hampers your ability to make informed decisions about
promotions
, training needs, or staffing adjustments.
Building a Unified Staff Management System
The solution to your staff management woes isn’t simply hiring more managers. Instead, it’s about creating
systems that work consistently
across all locations—whether you’re there or not.
Why you need centralized policies and procedures
Chaos ensues when your
workplace policies
aren’t clearly defined or easily accessible. Think about everyday situations like
shift swaps, time-off requests, and sick days
. Without standardized procedures, each location handles these differently.
One location may allow informal shift trading via text, while another requires written requests submitted at least 48 hours in advance. This inconsistency creates confusion, which leads to
scheduling conflicts
that put your
class schedule
at risk when staff don’t show up, expecting someone else to cover.
Centralized policies eliminate the guesswork and ensure
fair treatment across all locations
. When you get this right, you’ll see immediate improvements in staff satisfaction and operational consistency. 👍

The importance of standardized onboarding and training
According to
Jobvite
,
30% of workers will leave a job in 90 days or less
.
BambooHR
found that employees make their decision to stay or leave within just 44 days—
less than two months
after their start date

Poor onboarding experiences create
early turnover
, which costs you thousands in recruitment costs and disrupts operations (not to mention the member experience). By contrast, a
great onboarding experience
can pay dividends for
years
to come. Standardized onboarding improves staff retention and builds the consistent team culture your members expect at every location.

Staff Training and Professional Development
Once you have centralized policies in place, the next step is ensuring every team member can deliver on
your brand promise
. Consistent training and ongoing development are what separate good multi-location operators from great ones.
Why consistent training ensures a unified member experience
Your members expect the same
quality of service
whether they visit your downtown location or suburban branch. But without standardized training, each location develops
its own interpretation
of your brand standards.
Consistent training programs ensure that
every staff member understands your expectations
, from how to greet new members to handling billing inquiries. When a member walks into any of your locations, they should feel like they’re getting the
same exceptional experience
they’ve come to expect from your brand.
This consistency builds
trust and loyalty
. Members know what to expect, and staff feel confident in their abilities to deliver.
Ongoing professional development opportunities
Training shouldn’t stop after onboarding.
Ongoing professional development is a huge motivator
for fitness staff who are passionate about health and wellness. Whether it’s new fitness certifications, customer service workshops, or leadership training, investing in your team’s growth pays dividends.
Staff who see a clear path for advancement are more likely to stay engaged and committed to your business long-term.

The fitness industry is growing steadily and evolving. Americans are abandoning their traditional gym memberships in favor of more expensive, trendy boutique fitness studios. The

How to Start Your Own Boutique Fitness Studio
So, you’ve decided you want to open your own boutique fitness studio? You’ve got the passion and drive to make it a reality. As with any business, it takes a lot of hard work and effort to start your own fitness business. Before you take the plunge, here are nine things to consider when starting a boutique fitness studio.
Skip ahead to:
Do Your Research
As a business owner, you absolutely need a business plan before you open your facility. The business plan is the backbone of any business and needs to include a ton of detail so that you make well-informed decisions down the line. Your business plan will give you a realistic view of the future and also help you secure funding. Key elements to include in your business plan are:
Mission statement
Executive summary
Industry analysis
Competitive analysis
Marketing plan
Financial plan and projections
Whether you’re a fitness expert or personal trainer, you’ve probably already gained a mountain of knowledge from working in the fitness industry. But, you need to take that knowledge further and understand all the ins and outs of the business to give yourself the biggest chance of success. To get your business plan started, we’ve put together a
guide to help you create a thorough business plan
and explain exactly why you need one.
Startup, Franchise, or Purchase?
When starting a boutique fitness studio, you have a few options that you could take. If you want to start from scratch and grow your brand from the ground up, then a startup is for you. There’s also the option to buy into a franchise. When you buy into a
fitness franchise
, a lot of the work has already been done for you in terms of building a brand and creating a blueprint for success. The final option is to purchase an already established business.
If you want total freedom and want to make every business decision, then a startup is for you. If you’re starting from scratch, some costs may be more expensive, and you have no brand recognition. With a franchise location, there is usually support and training already in place to help. However, you will probably have to follow specific guidelines and rules when it comes to running your business.
The bonus of purchasing an existing studio is that the brand already has some awareness and recognition. But, this can be a more expensive route to go down with certain companies. All these options have pros and cons, and the perfect option will depend on a number of different factors.
Finance Your Business
It takes a decent amount of money to open a business. There are multiple costs that you need to consider, both ongoing and one-off payments. From rent and fitness equipment to legal costs and employee wages, the expenses can add up quickly. During the planning stage of your business, think about how you will finance your facility. Are you willing to take on investors in return for a share of your company, will you take out a loan or save up the money yourself?

Opening a Gym or
Studio

When planning your finances, look at your overall costs as well as monthly payments. Hidden fees will always pop up, so make sure to have some financial cushioning in place. Depending on the type of business you want to open, the costs can vary massively. For more information, check out our guide on
counting the costs of opening a gym
in today’s fitness marketplace. Here are some costs you need to think about:
Facility costs
Licenses and permits
Gym equipment
Legal feels and insurance
Advertising and marketing
Gym management software and hardware
Permits, Licences, and Insurance
Your business will need the right permits, licenses, and insurance in place to run properly. Licencing and permit requirements may change from one state to another, so double-check that you’re following regulations wherever you’re based. Opening a gym can be a potential minefield so it’s crucial to understand any rules and regulations. This might be health and safety or even food hygiene regulations if you’re selling food and drink at your facility.
When it comes to business insurance, make sure you have adequate cover in place to protect you from any insurance claims. No matter how well-worded your legal contracts are with members and visitors, if a client hurts themselves due to faulty gym equipment, a claim could come your way. As a business owner, it’s your responsibility to put measures and processes in place to
keep your clients and employees safe
. There are different types of insurance to consider including:
General liability insurance
Building property insurance
Professional liability insurance
Workers’ compensation insurance
Prepare to Work
When you start your own fitness studio, there are multiple jobs and roles that need to be filled. Depending on your budget and position, you may end up performing a lot of these jobs yourself. If you’re a personal trainer, you might also end up doing general maintenance around the facility, accounting, admin, advertising, and marketing. All these jobs take up time and will add a lot of hours to your workday.
As your business grows, you can look to hire employees that fill specific roles. Writing emails, blogging, engaging with clients on social media all requires work. When running a business, there are a crazy amount of hours that go into it after everyone else has gone home. Prepare to work early mornings, late nights, and most days. Your family or social life may take a bit of a beating, but it will pay off in the end. Prepare to spend a lot of hours working, especially in the beginning, to build your business.
Be a Specialist
Some of the most successful boutique fitness businesses specialize in a specific area. Whether it’s martial arts, yoga, indoor cycling, high-intensity interval training or pilates-inspired barre classes, there’s a niche to suit your passion. Orangetheory Fitness is the leader in heart rate interval training. The boutique brand is a massive player in the fitness franchise industry. Eight years after opening its first studio in 2010, it surpassed $1 billion in systemwide revenue in 2018.
To specialize in a particular area of fitness, you need to have highly-trained instructors. Good trainers are an integral part of your business and will keep clients coming back again and again. Find the best instructors who will connect with your clients and give them the results they want. Spend time training them and hire excellent staff. The best trainers will come at a higher cost but will be worth it in the long run.
Make it a Destination and Create a Community
Boutique fitness brands like SoulCycle and Equinox have taken fitness a step further. These fitness brands have become lifestyle brands creating communities and a sense of belonging. You no longer just hit the gym, you wear your branded clothing and post on social media about your sweaty workout at your nearest SoulCycle.
Build a place where people like to hang out. There’s a reason that boutique fitness destinations are booming. By
creating a sense of community
with group fitness and your company culture, you will keep members coming back for more. You can cultivate both a physical community vibe as well as an online-based community through social media.
High Price, High Value
Fitness spending is flying high with luxury services in demand. The idea behind high price, high value, is that as you are offering a premium service, you don’t need to offer free trials. Many box gyms and traditional fitness facilities provide free trials or discounted offerings to get new clients in. Instead of offering free trials, provide paid trials or high price challenges that will get results. A high price relates to high quality with serious and noticeable results.
Listen to our latest podcast with the
founders of Hot House Yoga, Christopher and John Yax
to find out more about how to increase the value of your offering. The yoga entrepreneurs and brothers discuss how to create a compelling frontend that sells and the importance of keeping a consistent teaching style across all their studios.
The Right Marketing and Advertising
After you’ve worked so hard to start your business, you need to get the word out there that you’re open for business. It’s time to define and build your brand. In today’s digital age, marketing comes down to building an online following and awareness. Social media marketing and advertising are essential. You now have the ability to get in front of the right people in the right location with a click of a button.
Whether it’s Facebook advertising, connecting with a well-known fitness influencer in the area or regularly sharing behind the scenes snippets through Instagram stories, there are numerous different ways to market your business. Check out our guide to
marketing for the modern fitness founder
to find out how to grow an online following and unique marketing strategies you can use for your business.
In Summary
With the chance to be your own boss, build a company, and create a community your clients will love, starting a boutique fitness studio may sound like a dream. But, by taking the steps necessary to start your own business, you can launch your own studio and be ready to take on the fitness industry.

However, approximately one third of those who take up a new routine in January will quit before the month is out.
This leaves fitness business owners back where they started, reviewing monthly attendance reports while contemplating what they could have done differently. It makes sense to develop a ‘new year, new you’ member retention strategy using your
gym management software
NOW, that you can implement in January.
1. Embrace the Community Aspect
‘New Year New Me’ January members who attend classes alone and do not interact with other members are
more likely to drop off due to a lack of community motivation
. People don’t go to a fitness studio for a spinning bike or a yoga mat. They want to connect with other members with similar fitness aspirations. Ultimately, this is what will drive them to continue their fitness journey.
Aim to
prolong your member’s commitment to health and wellness
by connecting them with more than just a fitness goal. You could
encourage interaction between your members and trainers
by allowing a quick Q & A session at the end of class. Or, instead of a Christmas Party, why not have a January new members Party?
2. Add More Value
The level of value required to engage and retain members is growing all the time. To succeed in such a competitive market,
you
must
identify value adding benefits
that you (and only you) can give your customers. This could be something as simple as free online nutrition resources, only available to members, or
a mobile app for members to book and pay
– anytime, anywhere.
When you’re speaking with potential clients in January, be sure sure to run through all of the extra value they’ll receive from your service,
value that makes you stand out from your rivals
. The best fitness businesses find a way to add more value to their clients outside of their time working out or taking classes.
3. Subscription Payments
A subscription payment, or ‘recurring’ payment, is an automatic payment from a member’s bank account or credit card to your business. When you create a recurring membership plan, the membership will continuously repeat after a time period set by you, for example monthly.
Recurring payments are the best way to
build a long and stable business
, as they require a greater level of commitment from your customer. This in turn will encourage them to stick to their new fitness regime.
Monthly recurring subscription payments are now available via companies like
Stripe
, hassle free. If you use Glofox gym management software, we provide an integration with Stripe so that you can manage all of your subscriptions directly from the Glofox dashboard.

4.Mobile Marketing
Mobile marketing is a critical component
of your member retention strategy. With a mobile app, you have the ability to
deliver content to any customer who has downloaded your App
. Once used correctly, your App can be an extremely clever and effective tool to keep clients engaging with your business day after day.
All Glofox Apps have a Newsfeed feature where gym and studio owners can add valuable content for their members, such as blog posts, training videos, nutrition tips and general updates. That’s right,
your members can get their daily fix of fitness inspo, directly from
your branded app
!
You can
send your members push notifications
when a new piece of content is added to the newsfeed, encouraging them to check it out.
By keeping your members engaged through your app, they’re more likely to become loyal to your business.
5. Loyalty Program
Flexible class drop in rates are becoming increasingly common across gyms and studios, making it easier for customers to hop from studio to studio – without any commitment. Why not Introduce a loyalty program through your gym management software in an attempt to
reduce the number of customers you see dwindling away
by the end of February?
You can tailor your loyalty program so that it’s unique to your business. Why wait until the industry norm of the 10th class free? Why not give them their 6th class free? By doing so, you have the opportunity to
help your members realise the added value your business can offer
, in a shorter space of time. If you manage to keep customers for an entire year instead of just a month because of it – it’ll be worth it.
Members want to feel rewarded for their loyalty
and this is a great way of showing you care about them. Simple, but effective. Find a way of rewarding clients that works for your gym or studio. Remember, this is an opportunity to
convey your business’s unique characteristics
. Make the most of it!
To conclude, it’s time to avoid the revolving door of fitness by figuring out what combination of strategies work best for your gym or fitness studio.
But be cautious, don’t let existing customers slip away for people who aren’t even in your grasp just yet
. Be sure to identify the right balance between spending your energy on new and existing customers.
Find gym management software that works well for your business, and when you do, stick to it.

That said, there can be days where it’s down right not what you expected. Who knew there’d be so much admin involved on a day to day basis?
Fortunately, there are tonnes of processes you can automate through your gym management software that’ll help you work smarter, save time and let you focus on what you do best. As Paul from Origin Fitness told us in our recent blog post ‘‘
3 things you must do before opening your gym doors
”, if you get the right system and structures in place from day one, you can make your life a hell of alot easier in the long run.
Check out our pick of the top 5 automations that can help you spend your precious time wisely.
1. Online & Mobile Booking
Let’s start with the basics! Letting your members self service through online and mobile channels is the perfect way to take away the pain of managing bookings day in, day out. Instead of members calling up, emailing or even messaging you enquiring about a class our course booking, all your members have to do is simply sign in to their account and
book and pay for your services
through your Website Booking Portal or App.
If you don’t have a website, the same booking functionality could be applied to your
Facebook page
, depending on the gym management software provider you are working with. Think of all the new business you can create by having a presence on all of these different channels? You can create booking opportunities from the palm of your members hand. Not to mention the other automations that can be put into place once this is setup!
2. Class Pack Tracking & Check in
When you have the right software system in place, you can let your members
check-in to your facility
through an in-app barcode or key tag via a scanner. Not only will this help you to free your time from the front desk, but it also helps your members to get to class quicker.
If the member is on a class package, they can check how many class credits they have left when they scan in through their in-app barcode. This information can then be stored in an individual member profile on your backend admin dashboard, helping you keep better track of your members. The best part? You don’t even have to lift a finger.
3. Cancellations & Waiting List
You may think “why would I make it easy for my members to cancel a class? I want them to attend!” But in reality, when you make it difficult for your members to cancel their booking, they won’t cancel. Instead,
they just won’t show up
. Leaving you with
lost revenue
that could have been prevented. When you make it easy for members to cancel, they are more likely to do so instead of simply not showing up. Once you have a strategy in place to refill that spot, cancellations can be easily managed.
The Customer
Engagement Playbook

Business
Discover more
This is where an automated waiting list can come into play, helping you to refill class spaces automatically. Once your class hits booking capacity, your gym management software will enable your waiting list. As soon as a member cancels their booking, depending on the unique rules you set for your studio, a member will automatically be notified and booked in for that class, so you can avoid the last minute booking cancellation panic.
4.Recurring Payments
Did a client walk out after class before you had the chance to have that ‘overdue membership fee conversation’. Your members are only human. From time to time, their
membership renewal payment
may slip their mind. One way you can start getting paid on time is by setting up your loyal members on recurring payment plans.
A recurring payment is an automatic payment to your gym or studio that continuously repeats after a time period set by you, for example monthly, bimonthly or quarterly. The first payment is authorised by the member via a debit card, credit card or bank account and the payment is repeated thereon.
Here at
Glofox
, we integrate with
Stripe
for payments. If a member’s payment fails with Stripe, they will attempt to take the payment three more times after the initial fail (you can choose how many days should be left between each attempt). Not only is this a convenience for your busy members who may just have been waiting on a late pay cheque, but it will reduce your need to chase members for payments. You also have the option to automatically cancel the member’s subscription after a third failed attempt, or simply list the member as ‘unpaid’ and try again next month.
5.In-app Reminders & Notifications
There are five words that can break any gym or studio owners heart after carefully crafting an email newsletter. “I didn’t get the message”. They did. They just didn’t open it. As we discussed in the blog ‘
driving member value through push notifications
’, 77% of your members aren’t opening your emails. And so, if you plan on retaining members in the long run, you need to adapt to the one channel that can really tackle this issue: Mobile.
When you have a
mobile app
on your member’s phone, you have a direct way to target your customers with messages. You can’t get much closer than their very home screen! By setting up automated booking confirmations, pre class reminders, and membership renewal reminders, everyone stays in the know.
And notifications aren’t just for your members! With Glofox, you can set up email notifications to admin accounts under various circumstances. For example, you may wish admin accounts to be notified when a member books a particular class, course or appointment. You can also set up notifications for failed payments, upcoming membership renewals or payments due, to name a few.

Waitlists and drop-in features
Full classes
are a good problem to have. But turning away enthusiastic members creates unnecessary friction, not to mention possible lost revenue.
Waitlists allow members to
join a digital queue when classes reach capacity
. If someone cancels, the system automatically notifies the next person on the waitlist and reserves their spot. This maximizes class attendance while giving members fair access to high-demand sessions.
The drop-in feature is equally powerful
. Visitors can purchase single sessions without commitment, helping you monetize
every available spot
while introducing potential new members to your community.

ABC Glofox allows members to create personalized profiles with

. The system then recommends relevant classes and sends timely reminders to boost attendance.

Booking should be the easiest part of working out, not another hurdle for your members to overcome. With the right gym management software, you’ll remove this friction point entirely.
Reason #3: Custom mobile experience for members
Your members live on their phones. If your gym isn’t there too, you’re missing a massive opportunity to strengthen relationships and boost revenue.
Branded fitness app for your gym
Your gym deserves more than a generic booking system. ABC Glofox creates a
fully branded mobile experience
that puts your fitness business directly in members’ pockets.
Members download YOUR app—not ours—with your colors, logo, and branding front and center. This digital extension of your gym
builds brand loyalty
while giving members the convenience they expect.

In this interview, Vanessa sheds light on the ever-evolving dynamics of the fitness industry and why fitness businesses need to find their unique selling point. With a career spanning over two decades, Severiano’s advice can help you understand what you need to do to prepare for the future of the fitness industry.
Vanessa’s Journey: From Crunch to Entrepreneurship
Vanessa Severiano’s career began at
Crunch’s
corporate office in New York City. Her decision to sidestep law school in favor of working with mission-driven, exciting brands marked the start of an illustrious career. Vanessa later contributed to the launch of
Equinox
in Florida and played significant roles at DavidBartonGym and Flywheel. Her pivotal moment came with the opportunity to develop a brand from scratch in Miami, a venture that she led for over six years. Now, Severiano leverages her vast experience to consult for fitness and wellness brands.
Adapting to Changing Consumer Expectations
“The consumer is expecting to be able to work out online, to be able to work out in-person, to have a community aspect. We really have to rise to the occasion and meet those consumer expectations.”
The fitness market has transformed, with consumer expectations now extending beyond the confines of brick-and-mortar locations. Severiano emphasizes the need for fitness brands to adapt and provide value through a blend of online and offline experiences, fostering community, and focusing on health benefits beyond mere aesthetics.
The traditional will no longer work for most fitness businesses – now is the time to innovate and find out what your unique selling point really is.

Discover Your Own Unique Selling Point
Embrace Digital Transformation
“Right now, you have to adapt to be able to thrive.”
It’s hard to justify a $150-a-month subscription to members when they can get a similar offering online for $10. To overcome this, you need to either provide an exceptional customer experience from start to finish, or you need to develop a hybrid model that allows you to capture those online customers that you’re currently losing out to.
This brings us to our next tip, one which should be at the core of your conversion tactics.
Get Sincere With Your Members
The day of the hard sell is over. People are constantly being bombarded by advertisements, product offerings, and pitches from every angle. Your fitness business should be an escape from that. Trying to strongarm people into signing a contract will just lead to them canceling their membership as soon as they can.
Instead, treat them as what you want them to become – devoted members of your fitness community. Don’t jump into the sales pitch; instead, take the time to learn about the reason why they’re looking to join your gym or studio. Understand their needs, the job that your business does for them, and then offer them to join. Remember, most people are going to work out in a physical location because they need accountability, a fixed time, and guidance. If you can provide that, you’ll quickly have a dependable and highly devoted community of members.
Vanessa explains it perfectly:
“People are willing to pay for accountability, your time, and attention. If you are a fitness brand providing those things for people, then you can justify your value and you can continue to grow.“
Community is by far the most important aspect of your business for member retention. If you can make your new members feel welcome and involved from day one, you will have a significant chance of keeping them as long-term members. Just remember that when your members show up, you have to show up too. Be that dependable resource they’re looking for in their fitness journey.

Create a Stellar Community
“We have to rally around our members and our clients by creating community. Really, it all boils down to creating relationships”
Vanessa explains that businesses need to step away from the vanity pitch because it’s no longer the purpose of the fitness industry. People can get lean or lose weight on their own, what they need now is a community that’s not just for their body, but also their mind.
Mental wellness should be at the forefront of your business model. Not because it’s the most lucrative tactic, but because it’s what people are looking for and need right now.
You can build a thriving community in a thousand different ways, and it’s a lot easier than you might think. All it takes is sincerity and persistence. If you’re constantly showing up for your members and encouraging them, soon enough they will start doing the same for one another.
Something as simple as a monthly coffee get-together on a Saturday morning could be massively beneficial to the community you’re trying to grow. Then, instead of just seeing your business as a place to get fit, your members will quickly see it as a place to belong.
Finally, if your business is a physical location, stop seeing digital as the enemy, especially when it comes to community. Digital fitness is not the competition, it’s a tool. Any business can utilize it, as long as they have a clear path and the platform best suited to the job.
As Vanessa says:
“Digital is a tool. It’s not here to replace the brick and mortar. But it is a tool to use so that if I can’t make it to a class or I’m not feeling well, I can still exercise. I don’t have to miss out and I’m not going to another brand to get what I need.”

Glofox & Trainerize – Tools to Boost Your Online Business
Embrace Change and Celebrate What Makes You Special
“I would implore each business owner to look at their business and assess what are their key differentiators, what makes you stand out in the sea of fitness spaces and all the noise right now.”
The fitness industry is a very crowded place, but that shouldn’t be a problem for businesses that have a truly unique offering and a stellar community.
Take a step back from what you think your business provides and really see what makes your members want to exercise with you and your community. Providing a great workout is no longer enough for you to survive as a fitness business. You need to create an open, welcoming, and holistic member experience that ensures that you’re focusing on their mental well-being as much as their physical health.
Once you create that sense of belonging for your members, you know that you’ll be safe as a business.

For many, branding is an afterthought. However, a company wouldn’t exist without having an identity to live by, otherwise known as branding. Effective branding helps make companies more memorable and helps make an impression on their current and prospective customers.
Think of Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Apple or Airbnb. They all have iconic branding, and as soon as you see their logo, you know who they are. In fact, consistently presented brands
are 3.5 times more likely
to enjoy excellent brand visibility than those with an inconsistent brand presentation.
But being remembered isn’t just the only reason branding for your company is important. Branding shows the outside world what you are about and what your values are. A strong brand identity improves trust among your customers and helps build long term relationships with them.
In this article, we will look at what branding is, what different types of branding look like and  why it’s important for your business.

Why is branding important for your business?
What is a brand?
In 2009 world famous marketing guru Seth Godin
wrote this about brand
:
A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another. If the consumer (whether it’s a business, a buyer, a voter or a donor) doesn’t pay a premium, make a selection or spread the word, then no brand value exists for that consumer.
As you can see a brand is much more than a logo, color scheme or name. Your brand is what the outside world feels about your business. When a person thinks about a particular product or service, the idea that comes into their mind or the feeling they have is your brand. A brand should be consistent and be strongly felt at every touchpoint of your business.
Developing your brand can be tough. The best place to start is to ask yourself this question – how do you want the world to think and feel about your business? Then work backwards to map out a step by step plan to build your brand.
What is branding?
Branding is a method that companies conduct to actively shape their brand. As a business,
branding can help you blow away the cobwebs and capture your customers’ attention. It helps by adding meaning to your products and services.
Branding involves a strategy that helps others identify your brand easily and trust yours over your competitors. The main purpose of branding is to attract loyal customers and stakeholders by providing a product or service consistent with your company’s promise.
For example let’s look at fast growing fitness franchise Orangetheory. The brand is built around community and revolves heavily around technology. The logo uses the renowned Orangethoery splat, which slots in with the workout’s splat points and pulls the focus back to the results you can expect to achieve. Every part of the brand from the concept to the design has been thought out meticulously and it shows through in a very polished brand.

Types of branding
Branding can really help elevate your business, and there are multiple ways to do so. The most popular types of branding are:
Corporate branding
Large corporations conduct this type of branding to make their name well known to the public. Corporate branding involves making sure the name sticks to a promise; the corporation lives up to its reputation by providing consistent positive performance.
It has a strong stance regarding the service they offer. There are many benefits to corporate branding, such as on name brand recognition, quick customer trust over new products, and familiarity.
Product branding
This is the most popular type of branding. You can’t walk far outside of your home without seeing product branding happening. Product branding creates a strong brand by providing a memorable logo, phrase, and image that sets it apart from its competitors. One popular example is
Nike’s
swoosh logo which signifies performance and performance.
Service branding
Irrespective of what industry you are in, you have to provide an outstanding service. This type of branding places a strong focus on your customer and how your service makes them feel valued. It often explores extra items or things to add to your service to ensure your customers stay loyal to you.
Geographic branding
Geographic branding involves showcasing geographical elements such as cities, regions, countries, food, and more to associate with a company. This helps make companies more appealing to specific demographics.
Online branding
Online branding involves a company building a presence and positioning themself to their audience online. Typically this type of branding consists in creating a website, social media channel, or publishing a blog.
Offline branding
Just like the name suggests, offline branding is branding that happens offline. Common examples of offline branding are merchandise, print advertisements, billboards, commercials, and more.

Personal branding
Personal branding is for individuals or self-employed people like celebrities, actors, politicians, social media influencers, and more. It helps them become more famous and allows an audience to connect to you for what you want to be known for.
Minimalistic branding
This type of branding provides the “less is more” experience. Minimalistic branding is not exactly true to its word. This type of branding does have the main principles of branding, except it’s clean, sleek, and simple. It’s a mixture of subtle design and a clear layout to provide a clean image.
Activist branding
If you or your company has strong social values close to your heart and want to show them, this is known as activist branding. It helps you channel your positive social impact into your identity online or offline. Over time your brand becomes synonymous with your social cause.
Why is branding important for your business?
Branding is not something your company should take lightly and should definitely not be overlooked. In fact,
77% of B2B marketers
say branding is crucial for growth. Here are some of the key reasons what branding is so important for your business.
1. Larger identity and recognition
Do you want your company and products to be remembered by a mass audience? Branding helps people identify you easily without even having to try to. It provides more than just a logo, name, jingle, or anything else.
If your business has consistent elements, it will help stand out in a positive light to others. Often memorable brands have are consistent in the following:
Logo, website, color scheme
Advertising
Customer communication
Pricing
Customer experience online and offline
Sponsoring and partnerships
Product packaging and design
2. Builds trust
Having trust from your customers is one of the most vital things you can have to survive as a company. Trust isn’t always easy to come by either, but branding is an effective way to develop your customers’ trust.
If you don’t have your branding elements on point, it’s going to be even more difficult to gain people’s trust. Plus, nowadays, people look for credibility and constantly search for reasons to justify their decision when buying from a company. If you have branding, it helps you have that authentic edge over your competitors that don’t.
It helps better your advertising
If you don’t have proper branding, you won’t achieve much from just advertising alone. The right branding complements your advertising. After all, advertising helps align with your business’s values and identity. Plus, having the right branding helps speed up your marketing strategies and arguably be less expensive.
3. Branding is a great morale booster for employees
Many businesses become so focused on their customers that they often forget another valuable asset, their employees. If you can manage your branding well, your employees will definitely want to be part of it.
Plus, if you have branding and place it on merchandise and give it to your employees, they will likely feel valued and part of your team.
If you can manage to find a way to motivate your employees through branding, it might save you money, as they may be content enough not to ask for a pay rise as much. Plus, if your employees love your brand, they will live by it more often, promoting it by word of mouth to other people and acting as unpaid ambassadors.
4. Boosts customer loyalty
With the right branding, you can increase your customer loyalty. If you have good branding, you will display a more personal and human side to your customer base. If you do this, it’s more than likely your customers will be able to connect with you more.
It also shows your more than just money and that you exist for a purpose. If you can evoke your customers’ emotions through your branding, you’ll most likely build a deeper connection with them.
5. It can build your financial value
If you are a company that trades or wishes to trade publicly on the stock exchange, you will find your business value based on your company’s hard assets. Most of the value calculated is from your company’s branding. Often a solid brand will help encourage future business and expansion of your company.
6. It helps you reach like-minded people
To survive in business, you need to be able to make money and know your niche. Branding helps tie your niche together and get like-minded customers. Whether you are a big company or a startup, having a strong mission, vision, and goals will help customers see your brand.
7. Builds confidence
Great branding helps create confidence in a company. It takes a lot to tell your customers who you are and why you are better than your competitors. However, having a consistent brand will generate confidence in you, your company, and your employees making new customers feel comfortable buying from you.
8. It tells your company’s story
Sometimes we don’t have the time to read on the go or listen to an advert. Our attention is scattered by so many things that we face daily. This is why having the right branding, such as logo design, colors, and taglines help tell people who you are without sharing much.
In summary
For your company to survive, you need to make a profit and have growth and loyal customers. Having the right branding tells customers a story about who you are and your values without saying much.
Branding also establishes credibility and a sense of authenticity, allowing you to be trusted over your competitors. This is so important in this day and age as there are so many brands online people can easily switch over to someone else.
If done well, it also helps you save time and money on your advertising. This way, you can create a compelling campaign.
To ensure your brand is consistent with your values, it’s always good to review it every 6-12 months. This will allow you to have a better idea of how your brand is seen within your industry.

f70adda0dfa047c2bae13ff1e90b171f9c62544b1c72760a1b443a46de24661f,GloFox (ABC Fitness),https://www.glofox.com/blog/why-the-most-successful-pilates-studios-think-like-brands/,Why the Most Successful Pilates Studios Think Like Brands,2025-10-24 16:59:10+00:00,2025-10-27 13:58:18.322694+00:00,"There’s a quiet evolution happening in boutique fitness. The most successful studios aren’t just teaching classes; they’re building brands.
They’re moving beyond the reformer, creating experiences that feel intentional, personal, and unmistakably their own.
In the Pilates community, where quality and connection are everything, this shift is redefining what success looks like. Profitability no longer comes just from full schedules; it comes from strong identity, consistent engagement, and a member experience that feels authentic and connected.
So, what does it mean to “think like a brand,” and why does it matter now more than ever for Pilates studios?
TL;DR:
The most successful Pilates studios are not just teaching classes. They are building brands that create consistent, memorable experiences for their members. Thinking like a brand means focusing on connection, clarity, and community at every touchpoint. When your studio delivers a feeling as strong as its workout, loyalty and profitability follow naturally.
#1: A Brand Is an Experience, Not a Logo
Your brand is a feeling clients associate with every interaction. From the moment they book a class, to the way they’re greeted when they arrive. It isn’t your name, color palette, or even your reformer layout. Does that play a role, absolutely—but it is not the true brand that resonates with clients and has them coming back.
The experience starts long before the client walks into your studio. Your app, your booking flow, and your communications all shape how professional, premium, and consistent your brand feels.
Studios using a fully branded member app keep their brand front and center. Members see your logo, your colors, and your tone of voice – never another company’s name.
In contrast, a generic or shared platform introduces a third-party brand to your clients, which can dilute your identity and create a disconnect between your physical and digital experience.
A branded app reinforces your professionalism and ensures your clients stay immersed in your studio’s world every time they book, check a class schedule, or engage with your community.
In a crowded wellness market, experience is your differentiator. When members know what to expect and how they’ll feel, they build emotional trust. That trust turns into retention and referrals, which are far more sustainable than constant promotions or discounts.
Thinking like a brand means designing your studio experience with intention.
Every touchpoint reflects your values
Every class feels consistent, no matter who teaches it
Every client interaction reinforces your studio’s promise: empowerment, calm, community, or strength
Overall brand consistency is what turns casual clients into loyal members.
#2: The New Standard: Community Over Commodity
In the past, studios competed on location, price, or schedule. Today,
community is the
new currency.
Members want to feel part of something. A part of a culture that reflects their lifestyle and values. A place to build a community and connect with those with like values.
Successful Pilates studios are using technology to nurture that sense of belonging beyond the reformer.
Through community features inside their branded app, members can engage with updates, celebrate milestones, and stay connected.
Push notifications and in-app messages make communication both feel timely and personal, while exclusive challenges help maintain motivation between classes.
The most forward-thinking studios aren’t just managing classes; they’re building communities. When members feel connected through a consistent digital and in-studio experience, they stay longer, more engaged, and refer friends naturally.
When your studio becomes part of someone’s identity, price becomes secondary. They don’t compare you to the studio down the street; they compare every experience to yours.
#3: The Business Shift: From Operator to Curator
Many Pilates professionals start as instructors who love teaching and evolve into business owners who wear every hat. The next evolution is becoming a
curator
; someone who designs an ecosystem of people, systems, and services that reflect the brand’s promise.
Curators don’t chase every new idea. They build systems that sustain the right ones. They’re selective about partnerships, programming, and marketing to ensure everything aligns with their studio’s purpose.
This is where operational excellence meets artistry. When your processes are automated and your data is clear, you have space to think creatively again. You
lead
instead of
reacting

#4: Storytelling Is the New Marketing
Marketing today isn’t about constant sales messages; it’s about storytelling.
People don’t simply remember your offers – they remember how you make them feel.
Pilates studios that think like brands use stories to create connection:
Member spotlights that celebrate progress and community
Behind-the-scenes glimpses of instructors and routines
Authentic reflections from the founder or team
These stories humanize your brand and create emotional equity. Discounts can’t do this!
When done right, your brand story makes clients proud to be part of your studio. It becomes
their
story too.
#5: Technology as a Brand Amplifier, Not Replacement
There’s a misconception that technology makes fitness experiences less personal. In reality, the right tools make them more consistent, connected, and aligned.
Automation doesn’t replace human touch, but ensures it happens reliably.
A well-timed message that celebrates a client’s 10th class feels personal.
A reminder that reduces no-shows feels considerate.
A seamless booking app shows professionalism.
The best studios use technology as a canvas to deliver their brand experience beyond the walls of the studio.
When your tech feels like an extension of your brand, members see your studio as thoughtful, modern, and effortless to engage with.

#6: Data is the New Intuition
Passion got you here. Data will take you further.
Thinking like a brand means making decisions based on instinct and information.
Get important insight by tracking information such as:
Which classes fill fastest
When cancellations spike
Who your most loyal members are
How engagement changes over time
Data shows where your story resonates and where it needs refinement. It helps you adjust without guessing, which protects both your member relationships and your revenue.
#7: Authentic Brands Don’t Compete, They Belong
Studios that think like brands understand that success isn’t about being the cheapest or trendiest. It’s about belonging in the lives of your clients.
When your values are clear and your experience consistent, you naturally attract people who align with them. You don’t have to fight for loyalty; it forms on its own.
Authenticity creates magnetism. Members who believe in your approach become ambassadors who spread your message organically.
#8: The ROI of Branding in Pilates
The studios with the strongest brand identities tend to see:
Higher retention:
Members stay because they feel connected.
More referrals:
People share what resonates emotionally.
Simpler operations:
Clear values streamline decisions.
Higher profitability:
Consistency drives long-term growth.
The essence of thinking like a brand is by turning clarity and culture into measurable business outcomes.
Conclusion
The Pilates industry is maturing. What once set studios apart, like location or schedule, is now a baseline. What truly differentiates a studio is how it makes people feel, both inside and outside the class.
The most successful Pilates studios are not just teaching movement. They are curating experiences, shaping communities, and building brands that inspire trust and belonging.
Your brand is not what you say. It is what your members feel every time they interact with you. When you design for that feeling, profit naturally follows.

Between managing class schedules, memberships, payments, client communication, and staff coordination, there’s a lot happening behind the scenes. And, as yoga grows in popularity and offerings diversify (think
hybrid classes
, on-demand video libraries, and multi-location setups), studio owners need more than intuition and spreadsheets to run a successful business.
Enter: yoga studio software. Because the right platform does more than save you time. It’s the missing link that transforms how you operate and engage with your community. And these days, it’s a must when it comes to
growing your business
.
Why Yoga Studios Need Specialized Software
As you know, yoga studios are unique. And, unlike traditional gyms or fitness centers, yoga spaces thrive on connection, flexibility, and flow. That same intention should extend beyond the studio walls—straight into the way your business is managed. And, your
software
should reflect that.
When it comes to choosing the perfect
software
, keep in mind that generic booking tools or clunky admin systems often lead to scheduling mishaps. In addition to missed payments, and frustrated clients.
But, on the flip side, specialized yoga studio software is designed to support the specific needs of your business: Think of needs like:
Multiple class types and instructors
Tiered memberships and flexible pricing
Seamless client communication
Hybrid offerings (in-person + online)
And, with the right tools in place, you’ll be able to automate the busywork and focus on what you do best. Like,
strengthen your brand
, and free up more energy to focus on what you love: teaching yoga.
Core Features to Look for in Yoga Studio Software
Now that we’ve covered why specialized software is essential, let’s break down the features that matter most. These tools aren’t just nice-to-haves. Instead, they’re game-changers when it comes to managing your studio with ease. To help you get started, we’ve rounded up the top six features to look for to help you make an informed choice.
Class Scheduling and Online Booking
First, your schedule is the heart of your studio. So,
choose a platform
that makes it easy for members to view, book, and manage classes from anywhere. And, if you are able to find bonus features like waitlists, recurring bookings, and instructor substitution tools, then even better!
Membership and Package Management
Then, whether you’re offering unlimited
monthly memberships
, 10-class passes, or drop-ins, your software should handle it all without a hitch. So, look for tools that allow you to customize pricing, expiration dates, and auto-renewal options.
Automated Billing and Payment Processing
Now,
no one wants to chase payments
. So. be sure to look for reliable yoga studio software that will handle billing behind the scenes. From collecting recurring payments to sending reminders for failed transactions, make sure your platform offers secure, PCI-compliant processing.
CRM and Client Communication
Next, a great client experience starts with
great communication
. And, integrated CRM features let you send automated emails, personalize follow-ups, and celebrate milestones (like birthdays or anniversaries). So, look for a software that keeps your community feeling seen and supported.
Branded App for Seamless Member Experience
Now,
your brand matters
. And, a custom-branded app lets your members interact with your studio on their terms. Think booking classes, managing memberships, and receiving updates from their phones. It’s convenience and connection, all in one place and a win-win for everyone involved.
Reporting and Performance Tracking
Next,
data-driven decisions
= sustainable growth. So, look for software that gives you visibility into key metrics like class attendance, retention rates, revenue trends, and instructor performance. After all, with clear insights, you’re better able to pivot quickly and plan for long-term success.
Choosing the Right Yoga Studio Software
Now, you’ve explored the features. Next, it’s time to figure out which platform is the best fit for your studio. Choosing the right software isn’t just about checking boxes; it’s about aligning with your goals, your team, and your members’ expectations. Here are some tips to get you started.

Know Your Business Model and Needs
First, every studio is different. So take the time to look at how your business is running. For example, are you running a boutique single-room space? Managing multiple locations? Offering teacher trainings or workshops? Get clear and then make a list of your
must-have features
based on how your business runs today. Then think big and look at where you want it to go tomorrow.
Prioritize User Experience—For You and Your Clients
Next, if your team struggles to use the system, it won’t matter how feature-rich it is. So, look for an
intuitive interface
, mobile-friendly design, and smooth navigation. Your clients should be able to book a class in under a minute. And you need to be able to update your schedule just as fast.
Ask About Customer Support and Onboarding
Now, tech hiccups happen. And, when they do, responsive support makes all the difference. So, choose a provider that offers live chat, email, or phone support—plus onboarding sessions and an easy-to-follow help center.
Ensure Scalability and Integration Capabilities
Finally, today you might run one studio. But, tomorrow you might open three more. So pick a platform that will grow with you. As well as one that is able to easily integrate with your
website
, marketing tools, and accounting software. Flexibility and future-proofing matter.
5 Tips for a Smooth Transition to New Software
Next, switching to a new system often feels daunting. But, with the right approach, it doesn’t have to be. A thoughtful rollout plan will ensure your team feels confident, your data stays intact, and your members experience a seamless shift. Here’s how to make it happen.
#1: Get Buy-In from Your Team
First, your instructors, front desk staff, and admin team will all interact with your new system. So, be sure to make them part of the decision-making process early and provide training to set everyone up for success. This helps everyone feel involved and on the same page.
#2: Start with a Demo or Free Trial
Next, don’t be afraid to kick the tires. Most reputable platforms
(Like ABC Glofox)
offer a demo or limited-time trial. So, use this time to test workflows, ask questions, and make sure the experience feels right for you and your members.
#3: Migrate Data with Support
Now, data migration has the potential to feel overwhelming. So, don’t go at it alone. Instead, work with a provider that offers hands-on help to transfer member info, schedules, payment history, and more. This makes the process so much smoother.
#4: Set Up Automation Early
Next, from auto-confirmations to failed payment reminders,
automation
is your best friend. So, implement these features from day one to help save everyone time and boost member engagement.
#5: Monitor Engagement and Retention
Finally, once you’re up and running, track how members interact with the new system. Are they booking more classes? Dropping off? Be sure to use the built-in analytics to adjust and improve. This helps your business and studio stay ahead of the curve.

is always a hectic time, so we’ve put together a New Year’s resolution checklist to help ensure you stick to all your great intentions.
Kick 2018 off to a killer start with the checklist below!
This could be your best year yet.
1. Business Plan
Have you made the assumption that passion and optimism alone is enough to build a successful gym or fitness studio business? Unfortunately,
running a business without a business plan can prove extremely time-consuming in the long run.
It’s important to take the time to sit down, research and develop a plan in full before launching. Your ability to
transition from a trainer/teacher to a business owner mindset
will play a crucial role in the planning process.
Start by setting:
☐
Business Goals:
These should encompass what you want your business to achieve in a specific time frame. This will include the mission and vision of your business and goals to accomplish.
☐
Industry Placement:
Do you want to be referred to as an affordable open gym with community at the heart of everything it does, or a high end yoga business? The industry placement you choose should be
reflected throughout your fitness business
; from the name of your business and the look and feel of your studio, right up to your communication style with clients.
☐
Budget:
Breakdown the anticipated costs for the year ahead such as marketing, equipment fees and monthly expenses. Following this, analyse your projected income for the short and long term. This should include financial goals and a defined strategy for achieving those goals. If you use a
gym management software
such as Glofox, you can use the reporting tool to collect valuable insight on your sales data from the previous week, month or even year.

4 steps to get your business financially ready for January
2. Marketing Plan
In your business plan, you should consider
setting out a marketing plan
with realistic objectives that you can follow throughout the business year. Firstly, you should try to gain an understanding of your
target market
so that you can create an offering that will grab their attention.
Get your creative juices flowing with these three questions:
The Customer
Engagement Playbook
for Your Fitness
Business
Discover more
Who is my ideal customer?
How will my service resonate with my ideal customer?
How will I reach my ideal customer?
☐
Social Media Marketing:
Identify the most popular social media channels where your target market hangs out and interact and engage new and existing members. Tag your clients in posts on Facebook in appreciation for their loyalty. Even reach out to their friends who have interacted on your page and invite them to a free workout!
☐
Mobile Marketing:
Push notifications sent through your gym management software are a great way of maintaining member engagement outside of classes. Glofox clients who see the best results in terms of customer retention, send customised messages to inactive members.
3. Customer Retention Strategy
A hallmark of the fitness industry is the
upsurge in new fitness regimes come January
; it’s hard to miss. As those of you who read our last blog post will know, this is the time when most businesses should try to maximise revenue and retain business for the rest of the year. However, research has shown that approximately one third of those who take up a new routine in January will quit before the month is out. Utilising a subscription based membership as part of your strategy can reduce those losses for the remainder of the year.
This leaves fitness business owners back where they started, reviewing monthly attendance reports while contemplating what they could have done differently. It makes sense to develop a ‘new year, new you’
member retention
strategy for your fitness business now that you can implement in January.
For the details, check out our recent blog post to help you on your way to
retaining clients post January rush!
4. Customer Acquisition Strategy
Each and every fitness business should have defined fitness marketing performance indicators in an attempt to guide client acquisition activity.
Uhuru Network
recommend quantifying the following performance indicators:
☐
Leads:
How many people are you reaching who fall into your target market? Once this number has been defined, set a goal and work towards it with targeted lead generation techniques such as blogging.
☐
Conversion Rate:
For example, if you offer a free class as part of your acquisition strategy, you should be monitoring how many leads actually take up the offer. Following this you can identify how many of these people continue to become long term clients and how many drop off. This will help you to figure out what offers are working for your business and which are not providing bang for your buck.
☐
Retention Rate:
Do your members rejoin your gym or studio when their current membership expires? At what rate? It costs five times more to get a new customer than to retain an existing one. This stat should puts it all into perspective.
Should you focus on working harder to keep members
as opposed to running around trying to acquire more?
☐
Member Lifetime Value:
This is the amount a member is worth the period of time they spend at your gym or studio. This measure can be obtained by summing up an average of all payments a member will make to your business over their entire membership.
2018 is approaching fast! Why not bring your New Year in with a bang with Glofox gym management software? You can
book your free consultation
before the rush is here.

This past weekend we joined our partner, ADCC (
Abu Dhabi Combat Club),
at the Miami Open. The Kicksite team is excited to be the ADCC’s official BJJ billing software and we’re always eager to find more opportunities to meet the martial arts community face-to-face.
CUSTOMER VISITS
Associate Sales Team Lead Mike and Senior Business Development Representative Rachel had the pleasure of starting their Florida trip on Friday by visiting the locations of a couple of our clients’ schools. The duo toured Kill Cliff MMA and Legacy 31’s sleek, incredible facilities. Moments like these that build our bonds further are always a highlight of our travels, and it was only the beginning. The real excitement was yet to come!
THE TOURNAMENT
The doors to the Miami-Dade County Fair & Exposition Center opened bright and early at 7 a.m. on Saturday, November 9th. The day was booked and busy, with 100% capacity. Amongst these eager attendees were 1,058 passionate competitors of all ages, supporters, and professors from all over the world, all gathered and ready to watch some awesome Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
The ADCC event was next-level and introduced Rachel (who traveled with us for the first time!) to a new world of martial arts outside of Kicksite. Every moment was high-energy, fast-paced, and thrilling. It could be overwhelming to some, but never for our crew. Mike showed Rachel the ropes, and she had the opportunity to meet current and potential future customers face-to-face. Meeting school owners who were introduced to Kicksite thanks to her outreach left Rachel even more excited to continue spreading the word of how Kicksite can make businesses better.
THE RESULTS
Of course, the ADCC Miami Open is more than just us talking about software; it’s about competition and the unifying passion of Jiu-Jitsu. When Saturday concluded, there were a total of 512 medals handed out: 182 gold, 180 silver, and 152 bronze were awarded to the best athletes at the event. Among these medalists, Kicksite is especially proud to highlight one of our longtime customers,
Alpha Miami Grappling,
for their Top Adult Team AND Top Youth Team rankings.
UNTIL NEXT TIME
At the end of the weekend, our team is most grateful to see so many familiar faces, hear how we’ve positively impacted their business, and discover ways we could do more for you. It’s an incredible experience to be away from home and united with those around us through martial arts. After an energetic event, we’re ready to take your excitement back to our home office. We’re always working to ensure our software, website services, and marketing services meet the gold standard you hold your own business to, and we have no plans of ever stopping.
Thank you to everyone at ADCC and our treasured customers for welcoming Kicksite into your space; we’re already looking forward to next time!"

(ASA) held the 2024 ASA Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Kicksite team was thrilled not only to be the exclusive software sponsor of the event, but also to join and give a presentation to martial arts business owners in attendance.
The 2024 ASA Summit started off with a bang (and a kick, and a punch) on Friday, October 4 with multiple interactive training and certification sessions. Renowned MMA trainer and UFC coach Eddie Cha first held a Level 1 certification, where participants learned the fundamentals of his signature striking system. We can’t give enough credit or respect to those who got certified –  this session was 3.5 hours long! We spoke to a few folks who were a part of it and although they were worn out, they were thrilled to have had the opportunity.
Eddie wasn’t done yet, though. Later in the day he hosted another session where he showed attendees how to incorporate UFC striking drills into their Taekwondo classes and programs. We had a chance to check this one out, and it was pretty awesome to see a packed room soaking in his knowledge and sparring with one another.
As these sessions took place, more attendees started to roll in and get the lay of the land before things officially kicked off.
At the opening ceremonies and introduction of speakers, we had the pleasure of hearing from a number of talented and accomplished Taekwondo school owners. They spoke to the challenges and opportunities of the martial arts business, and set the stage for a productive and valuable conference.
The guest speaker for the evening was also introduced – decorated wrestler, martial artist and UFC fighter Henry Cejudo. Cejudo shared his inspiring story and climb to success. Born to Mexican immigrants and enduring a difficult childhood, Cejudo found inspiration in his brother, an accomplished wrestler, and chose to follow his lead by getting involved in the sport. After years of training and success, he became a resident athlete at the US Olympic Training Center, and ultimately became the youngest American Olympic gold medalist in wrestling history at the time.
Cejudo parlayed this wrestling experience into MMA training, and signed with the UFC in 2014, being only the third Olympic gold medal wrestler in the company’s history. Since his signing, he became both the Bantamweight and Flyweight champion, and the seventh two-division champion in the organization’s history.
Cejudo’s overall message to the 2024 ASA Summit crowd was that big dreams combined with big sacrifices can result in big success. It was a relevant message for all in attendance, as everyone looked ahead to a day full of business-related seminars and speakers on Saturday.
Saturday’s sessions ran the gamut of business topics, with knowledgeable speakers across the board. We kicked off the day by sitting in on Josh Lannan’s presentation surrounding AI marketing. He called out some of the opportunities and efficiencies that school owners can take advantage of when it comes to the capabilities AI, but also wasn’t afraid to call out some of the challenges that AI presents (and some of the more terrifying things it can do).
Beyond the world of artificial intelligence, multiple school owners held sessions throughout the day discussing their personal secrets, recommendations, and tips for running a martial arts business. From harnessing the power of data and statistics to growing into a multi-location empire and even how to avoid burnout, there were endless nuggets of information to be scooped up and considered.
The Kicksite team was honored to be able to give our own presentation on Saturday afternoon. CEO Jason Neef was joined by Marketing Team Supervisor Pat Mullin and Senior Sales Engineer Mike Selck to talk through our own recommendations in the areas of finances, operations and marketing. While we may not be school owners ourselves, we’ve worked with thousands of them over the course of nearly 20 years. This has given us a lot of unique perspective into blind spots that academy owners frequently have, and some of the pitfalls we see them often run into. We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who joined us, and hope you found our seminar valuable!
Perhaps more than anything, our crew was glad to run into so many familiar faces and catch up with customers to talk about what we can do to keep helping their business grow. It’s particularly humbling and fills us with a lot of gratitude when we get to connect with owners who have been using us for over a decade! We’re always working to make our software, website services, and marketing services better, and in turn, make your martial arts business better.
Thanks to everyone at ASA, both organizers and attendees, for welcoming the Kicksite team to the 2024 ASA Summit with open arms! Check out our recap video below, and don’t hesitate to reach out if there’s anything we can do for you and your school."

Now that 2024 has come to a close, we wanted to take a moment to look back at the most notable updates made to the Kicksite software over the course of the year. We are always working to fine-tune and upgrade the system, and while some of those improvements are easy to see as you’re managing your school, sometimes there are less tangible (but equally important) updates that happen behind the scenes! Read on to check out our recap and as always, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Kicksite team if you need any additional trainings or assistance with the software.
Major 2024 Uplifts
Agreements Uplift
With our January 2024 Agreements uplift, we released a new centralized hub for managing all of your agreements and waivers. In the Agreements section, you can quickly create and customize agreement templates, send or sign agreements on the spot, and easily view and manage all signed and unsigned documents for your students. A simple also filter allows you to narrow your view down to certain agreement templates.

Programs Uplift
Also released in January 2024, the Programs uplift was a complete overhaul of the Kicksite Classic Programs feature. This update was not only a necessary visual overhaul of the Ranks Overview, Eligible to Promote and Promotions sections, it also helped improve overall user experience while navigating these areas and introduced new functionality. Collapsible lists, single-click promotion, and filters have helped make it make much more convenient and simple to manage your student ranks and promotions.

Family Profiles Uplift
Easily our biggest and most notable update in 2024, the entire Kicksite team was thrilled to roll out the uplifted Family Profile in August 2024! This new Family Profile was just the beginning of a much larger Families effort we are working on, and we are excited to introduce more in 2025! With the new Family Profile, you have access to features like:
Setting family
Primaries
who can view and manage information for all family members
Quickly viewing key family member profile details with hover cards
Easily adding new family members from existing students or by creating new students, all in the same simple modal
Adding family contacts who will receive important school information, but
WON’T
impact your active student total
A comprehensive
family finances module
that allows you to view and manage invoices, payment methods, and more for the entire family. Convenient filters let you view just one family member if needed!

Other 2024 Kicksite software updates
Bulk Sending Agreements and User Account Invites
These two 2024 releases are a reflection of our continued work on the Student List in Kicksite, and a desire to make it as easy as possible for owners and staff like you to save time by executing bulk tasks through that list. As you navigate to the Student List, you’ll now see ‘Add Agreements’ and ‘Send User Account Invites’ in the Actions list at the top of the page, along with other functions like Mass Check In, Change Status, and Delete People.

Student Profile Improvements
To coincide with our Family Profiles release, we also made improvements to the Student Profile to ensure a consistent experience while navigating between the two. This also included:
The rollout of
Student Profile module customization
, which allows you to reorder or hide the modules within a Student Profile.
Introducing
Pinned Comments
, so you and your staff can more easily highlight and prioritize crucial student information.

Family Management Form Invites
With the launch of the new uplifted Family Profile, we recognized that there were many schools who had Families previously set up in Kicksite Classic, with contact information that likely hadn’t been updated or cleaned up in quite a while. In an effort to facilitate this process and allow schools to use the new Family Profile to the fullest, we introduced a Family Management Form. When you send a Family Management Form invitation, families are directed to a form where they can clean up and assign phone numbers and email addresses. And most importantly, they are prompted to establish their Primary Contact, which is a key element of the new Family Profile.

Mobile Updates
More and more, people run their lives from their phones, and running your martial arts school is no exception! We recognize this need and have continued working to enhance the Kicksite mobile experience, and help you manage your business on the go. At the end of 2023, we rolled out some updates to the mobile experience in the Memberships section, and in early 2024 we followed that up with some additional mobile updates to these sections that improve the user experience and functionality:

We look forward to continuing these updates and making sure our software meets the ever-growing needs for people to work on their mobile device!
Ruby on Rails 7 Upgrade
You know how we mentioned those things that sometimes happen behind the scenes and may not be a fancy new feature, but have a big impact on the software’s functionality and user experience? This is one of them! So what on earth is Ruby on Rails? The short answer is that Ruby is a programming language, and Ruby on Rails is a framework written in that programming language. It’s effectively the entire foundation on which Kicksite’s software is built. Needless to say, it’s
pretty crucial
that we keep this framework as up-to-date as possible to ensure that the software continues functioning as intended, and with the speed and efficiency that our customers need. This upgrade was no small task – countless hours of labor and testing went into this upgrade, but we’re happy to say we made it happen in 2024!"

What is the Lunar New Year?
The Lunar New Year, also known as the Chinese New Year, marks the beginning of the
lunar calendar
. The Lunar calendar follows the lunar phases rather than the Gregorian calendar (January-December calendar used in most of the world). China most notably and enthusastically celebrates it, as well as other Asian countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, and Singapore. Japan used to officially celebrate the Lunar New Year, but shifted to the Gregorian calendar in 1873.
What is the Chinese Zodiac?
The Chinese Zodiac is a 12-year cycle consisting of a different animal sign for each year. The animals go in order as: the rat, the ox, the tiger, the rabbit, the dragon, the snake, the horse, the sheep (or goat), the monkey, the rooster, the dog, and the pig. Each animal is associated with and expected to have a variety of personality traits, similar to Greek astrology signs. Those who celebrate the Chinese New Year associate the personality traits to those born in the animal’s year.
2025 | The Year of the Snake
January 29, 2025 marks the beginning of the
Year of the Snake
, the sixth animal on the Lunar calendar and following the
Year of the Dragon in 2024
. According to the Chinese Zodiac, those born in the Year of the Snake are intuitive, intelligent, and strategic. People born in this year are also rational, calm, thoughtful, and loyal, especially toward loved ones. They are calm individuals who are capable of carrying out a plan from beginning to end without wavering. They are perceptive deep thinkers who stay skeptical.

Past years of the Snake: 1917, 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025
What does the Year of the Snake Mean for Small Business?
The Snake represents smart decisions and meticulous planning. In the Year of the Snake, you should focus on making and saving money. It is important to re-invest in your business but also know to put some money away for any scenario that might arise.
The Year of the Snake is also a time to fixate on steady, evenly paced progress. Fortunately, the discipline learned through martial arts can assist with this thoughtful approach. Although the general theme is to be contemplative and measured in your business efforts, it certainly doesn’t mean you can’t make big moves – just plan them out well! In fact, there have been some major inventions that rolled out during past Years of the Snake, including the compact disc (1977) and the iPod (2001). Maybe you’ve been considering launching a new program at your school, spearheading a rebrand, or another large venture. As long as you’ve done your homework and assessed the opportunity properly, this might be the perfect year to take the plunge.
In summary: as you manage your business in 2025, make sure you think ahead, analyze and prepare so you can strike like a snake. Stay focused, diligent, and patient, but pounce when the opportunity arises.

The new year is here, but time will start passing quickly. Don’t miss out on opportunities for new business – take advantage of these early days of 2025 by sitting down to map out your plans for promoting your martial arts school. A quote we’ve often highlighted here within Kicksite is Dale Carnegie’s adage “An hour of planning can save you ten hours of doing.” Our team is here to help you with that planning so your 2025 marketing efforts are fruitful and easy to execute! Keep reading our marketing guide for martial arts schools to see recommendations on how to best prepare plus key promotional periods to consider.
Set a schedule
Setting a schedule can be very impactful for your 2025 planning. Start by taking note of important months dates for your marketing plan. This could include holidays, monthly celebrations (Ex: August – National Wellness Month), seasons (summer camp!), tournaments, etc. You want to know which days/months are important and how far in advance you should start planning and promoting. Whether you use a Google Calendar, a traditional paper calendar, or a more advanced management software, take the time to set up reminders so you never miss out on relevant opportunities.
We get it – keeping track of every significant date could be difficult, and not everything makes sense for your business. So we took the time to pinpoint some that do. Here are some examples of things you can plan for, promote, and important dates for each month to celebrate or acknowledge at your martial arts school in 2025. These various holidays or promotional periods can be tied into social media posts, special offers that you create (Pro Tip: our
landing pages
are a great way to share these!), or unique experiences and activities that are incorporated into your schedule.

Domain names are a critical part of a strong online presence for new martial arts schools and those looking to adjust their image. However, Internet marketing is no longer new, and owners may find that the best domain names have already been scooped up. Choosing the right domain name is important to improve how potential students find the site and crucial for search engine results.
When most people think of the website, they will associate it with its domain name, which is why it’s critical to choose something unique and easy to remember. New martial arts schools or owners who want to switch domains should consider the following tips:
1. Keep it simple
For people to pass a domain along to friends and family members, the name has to be
easy to pronounce and spell
, according to an infographic from WhoIsHostingThis. If someone hears the domain name, the spelling should be obvious. Word-of-mouth referrals and search engine rankings will be higher with a simple domain. Plus, short domain names are easier to fit on business cards and other offline marketing materials.
2. Consider top keywords for domain name
If a domain name has a keyword people would typically use when searching for a school, the link will appear higher in the search engine results, a study from Sibername found. When possible, keywords should appear as one word without any hyphens. Hyphenated domain names can signal spam to search engines, and it makes it difficult to gain links.
3. Think about the extension
When available, martial arts schools should choose a top level domain .com because most prospective students will assume this is the extension, said WhoIsHostingThis. Extensions such as .org and .net have never captured the same performance levels as .com, but if school owners are unsure, they can purchase several extensions as long as they all direct back to the same site.
4. Domain should reflect brand
Domain names can be used as a marketing tool. This will improve word-of-mouth marketing efforts, and branded domains improve credibility in gaining links. Consumers are more likely to trust branded websites, and martial arts schools can benefit from the improved search results.
Since many domains are already taken, martial arts schools may need to be creative in the name they select. However, an effective domain is essential for potential students finding the school online."

Although search engine optimization can seem complicated, martial arts schools can benefit from increased traffic to their websites. If a site is more visible online, it can lead to higher enrollment at the school.
It’s no longer enough to create a website and leave it alone. Because of changes in Google’s search algorithm, websites that don’t utilize the most up-to-date SEO techniques could be penalized and displayed further down in the results or not show up at all. This can impact martial arts schools’ ability to attract new students.
Even though the rules have changed, there are simple steps martial arts schools can take to boost their online visibility:
1. Perform keyword research
Determining the right keywords is critical to the success of an SEO strategy, and even if the school has a bunch of search terms, additional research can be beneficial. Martial arts schools should identify overarching themes and the topics their target audience wants to learn about to create long tail keywords, according to an infographic from GoBeyond SEO. In fact, more than 70 percent of Google searches include 5 to 7 word terms.
2. Lay on-page SEO keywords
After conducting keyword research, it’s time to lay the groundwork on the site. Strong title tags are essential for good results. These should be utilized both around the site and with each post. Posts should also be relevant to overall themes. For example, if a martial arts school has a focus in tae kwon do, blog posts and other content should relate to that.
3. Eliminate duplicate content
If the same content is associated with two separate URLs, search engine bots can get confused and drop the site down in the rankings. While Google has stated sites won’t be officially penalized for duplicate content, it’s better to check for it and remove it through Google’s Webmaster tools, Business 2 Community said.
4. Create relevant content
Content marketing is becoming more important for driving traffic to a website. Martial arts schools can establish themselves as thought leaders, which will help both search engines and potential students find the website. Although the number of posts can make a difference, search engines are placing a higher value on quality content. A large volume of low-quality content won’t cut it anymore. Business 2 Community noted content should be optimized with keywords for the best results."

QR codes may have one of the biggest marketing comeback stories ever. The QR code was originally developed in the 1990s as a way to track vehicles during the manufacturing process. Marketers began to adopt the black and white squares in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, but the interest seemed to fade quickly as the years went on.
Then, along came 2020. More specifically, along came Covid-19. The pandemic breathed new life into QR codes as a means of providing important information to people in a touchless way. Since then, QR code usage has once again exploded, and now you see them everywhere you look: billboards, TV commercials, bars and restaurants, and even museums. And they don’t just exist, they’re actually being used. In a survey of US shoppers conducted in June 2021, 45 percent of respondents reported using a QR code to access marketing or promotional offers.
In 2022, we implemented a QR code generator into Kicksite’s Marketing Tools as a way to promote landing pages and lead capture forms. This new feature makes it even easier to share your gym or martial arts school’s landing pages and encourage new signups. But you might be wondering how you can best utilize these funky looking icons. Below we’ve compiled details and helpful tips for 6 effective ways to use QR codes:
QR codes on business cards
QR codes on window or door clings
QR codes on stickers
QR codes in print ads
QR codes on your phone lock screen
QR codes on student gear
QR codes on business cards
Business cards may not be as ubiquitous as they once were, but they can still be a valuable (and easily distributed) tool for passing on information to promote your gym or martial arts school. And now, placing a QR code on your business card allows you to bridge the physical-digital marketing gap in an interactive way. It might seem most obvious to use a vCard QR code on a business card so people can immediately save your contact information to their cell phone. But why not mix things up and have it send people to your landing page instead? They can learn more about your business and immediately jump into signing up for a free trial or even a full-blown paid membership.
Pro tip: Business cards don’t give you a ton of real estate to work with (standard size is 3.5” x 2”), but you’ll want to make sure that your QR code is at least 0.8” in size. This is widely considered the minimum dimensions needed for a QR code to ensure that it can be scanned properly.
QR codes on window or door clings
In a dream world, everyone who walks by your business feels compelled to walk in and check things out. But in reality, that’s not always the case. Fortunately, QR codes provide a great opportunity for those passersby to take a virtual “tour” on-the-go and learn more. A static cling for your glass door or windows is a simple and affordable way to display a QR code that leads to your landing page and allows people to sign up without stepping in the door.
Pro tip: It might be tempting to try to remove the white background from your QR code so that the glass serves as a transparent background, but resist the urge! Movement and inconsistent lighting behind the glass will make it difficult (or even impossible) for people to scan properly. Keep that white background when you print your decal and so there’s plenty of contrast!
QR codes on stickers
Stickers! You can put them anywhere! Well, within reason and legal limitations, anyway. Whether they’re slapped on your car, a laptop, or the myriad of stickerable objects in between, stickers allow you to turn just about anything into a billboard. And with all kinds of sizes and shapes available, stickers open themselves up to a lot of fun customization options to really express your brand. And while you’re at it, why not include a QR code leading to your landing page?
Pro tip: No matter what size or shape of sticker you decide to produce, you’ll want to make sure you include a very clear call-to-action in your design. Unfortunately, there are QR code scammers out there, so it’s best to make it clear why someone is (and should be) scanning your code if they randomly stumble across your sticker. This lends legitimacy and additional context to your business’ promotional materials.
QR codes in print ads
In an increasingly digital world, you might think print advertising is on its deathbed. But you’d be wrong! A
recent FinancesOnline study
found that 82% of consumers trust print ads the most when making purchase decisions. So if you’re considering this time-tested form of marketing by investing in local print ads, why not incorporate your QR code as an extension of your ad? In this day and age, having a digital experience tied to physical media is not only accepted, but oftentimes expected. Capture interest with a compelling print ad, then send them to your business’ landing page to close the deal and secure a membership.
Pro tip: If you’re putting your QR code on a white background, make sure there’s a “quiet zone” surrounding the code. In layman’s terms, don’t cram a bunch of stuff right next to the black squares and bars on your QR code! Having this buffer area will make it easier for phones to understand where the code starts and ends, and makes the code more scannable.
QR codes on your phone lock screen
Trying to spread the word via QR code in the least expensive way possible? Here’s a great option that will cost you zero dollars and gives you an instant way to share your landing page. Put your QR code on your phone’s lock screen! If you find yourself in a situation where you’ve struck up a conversation with a potential lead, you can simply whip out your phone and prompt them to scan your code without even having to unlock it.
Pro tip: Mind your proportions and positioning. Although your phone screen is vertical, you absolutely don’t want to stretch your QR code vertically to fill the space (this will make it unscannable). Maintain the square proportions of the original code and make sure it’s fully visible on your screen. You’ll also want to be sure it’s not obscured by the clock or any other system icons.
QR codes on student gear
Your students are likely already some of your biggest champions. While they may be promoting your gym or martial arts school through word-of-mouth advertising, QR codes can add a physical, interactive element to their advocacy. If you provide apparel, a subtle QR code on the back neck of a t-shirt or rashguard can be a simple way for your students to encourage immediate sign-ups while they’re out repping your school.

When we introduced our new member portal in June 2022, we also rolled out an engaging new tool: Achievements. With Achievements, you can create highly customizable awards for your students and members to recognize significant milestones in their training – or, just for fun!
We’ve seen a number of our customers taking advantage of the Achievements tool, but one school is definitely going above and beyond when it comes to utilizing this feature:
Droogs MMA & Jiu-Jitsu
in Pottstown, Pennsylvania.
Droogs has set up an extensive list of achievements in Kicksite to incentivize all kinds of student participation beyond training and attendance: leaving reviews of the school on social media, using the Kicksite mobile web app, and even cleaning the facility. We reached out to the awesome folks at Droogs to pick their brains and get a deeper glimpse into their unique use of the Achievements tool.
First off, tell us a little bit about Droogs. What inspired you to open your school, what makes you special, and what keeps you motivated?
Droogs means friends which is exactly why we chose to name our academy this.  The four business owners behind Droogs are four close friends (two couples) who met at our head affiliation, Paramount BJJ, in Downingtown, PA.  We had only known each other a couple years but two of us (AJ & Cathryn) had been dreaming about opening a Jiu Jitsu academy and we wanted to find someone(s) to supplement that academy with an MMA and striking program.  Once we met Dan and Emily, everything just came together.  Our inspirations draw from wanting to cultivate a positive community, bring a safe space to the local area, develop a high-level competition gym for those who are interested and create a legacy for those who will come after us. We are motivating intrinsically through competing, training and teaching.  We are also motivated extrinsically from each other and our students who are progressing at an incredibly fast rate. We are special because we are personally invested 100% in our students. When they sign up with us, they are not just signing up for a membership, they are signing up to be a part of our family, culture and lifestyle.
We recently rolled out a new Achievements feature at Kicksite, and you all are using it in a really cool and effective way. Tell us about your approach to creating Achievements.
We decided to use the achievements to recognize our students not just as martial arts, but also as people in life doing awesome things.  We want our students to know that we see what they are doing, both on and off the mats, and that we award them “achievement points” for bettering themselves in life.  Students can get points for a variety of things including doing well in competition, earning stripes, being consistent, helping new students and more on the mats.  Off the mats, they can be awarded for cool things in their daily life like starting high school, getting a promotion, donating to charity, etc.  Dan, one of our instructors/owners, even gives himself the “hunk of the month” achievement every month.  These points translate to eventual prizes.  These achievements aid in boosting comradery and increasing engagement… They also help us get students to clean our mats (HAHA!).
How has reception been to some of the unique awards you’ve created? Do you find that students are more inclined to participate and stay involved knowing they can potentially be rewarded?
This is an amazing question because now we have students lining up to mop the mats in order to get achievement points.  We definitely think our students are encouraged to participate through achievement points.  We think that these achievements not only help motivate our students further, but it also helps our students feel like we truly see how special and unique they all are.  For example, one of our students has completely changed his lifestyle through jiu jitsu, our fitness class, striking and healthy eating.  This has resulted in a 20-pound weight loss thus far.  He is even more inspired to continue on this path because he knows that we see him trying his hardest in here.
What’s your personal favorite Achievement that you all have created so far?
Dan’s favorite achievement is Hunk of the Month because he “wins” it every month.  Cathryn’s favorite achievement is the “You Can’t Teach Heart” achievement, which is given to the student who constantly demonstrates showing heart both on and off the mats.  They are self-motivated and always ready to improve/never give up.  AJ’s favorite achievement is “We Heard What You Did,” which is acknowledging an individual’s little victories in life.  Emily’s favorite achievement is “The Badass Lady” for the women who are not afraid to get out into a sport where there are more males and take it in stride.  They empower themselves and they uplift one another.
What would be your advice to other school owners who are hesitant to use or haven’t started using the Achievements tool yet?
Achievements is your chance to be creative and think about all the cool reasons why your students are special to you.  They are easy to find and use in the quick links tab and both you and your students will feel happier overall.  It costs you nothing to tell someone that they are crushing it!  It’s a free tool to use to boost engagement.
If you could create a special Achievement for Kicksite, what would our award be?
We would name our award for Kicksite, “The Work Smarter, Not Harder Awarder,” which is given to the software company that is all inclusive for what we need as a mixed martial arts gym.  Kicksite helps us keep track of finance, memberships, absences, merch and has the option for a website.  You can do it as an admin anytime from anywhere and someone is always available to help us.  It also does not kill all our finances (being a startup business) because Kicksite is fairly priced.  We did consider other names for this award and some of our other ideas were: “The 25/7 Software Award” for being always accessible, “The Best Bang for Your Buck Award,” and the “The Doing Our Job For Us Award.”"

It seems there’s an AI tool everywhere you look that can help you generate content, answer questions, or touch up your work. It’s the future of the digital space and it’s always evolving. AI could be your best friend when it comes to creating email, social media, or website content if used properly. With these simple tips, you can easily use AI tools to optimize your school’s marketing and improve content.
Do’s
1. PERSONALIZE AND DIVERSIFY YOUR CONTENT
With the variety of demographics you can target, it’s important to recognize each one has their own unique preferences and interests. Content that resonates with modern Gen-Z consumers will likely not align with an older audience. By utilizing AI you can identify common interests and overlaps.
One of the most notable AI tools is
ChatGPT
, where you can simply plug-in a prompt such as “common interests between young martial artists and competitors” to discover targetable topics, including inspirational fighters.
With specific details, you can craft a content strategy that appeals to the masses and ensures an engaged audience.
2. KNOW YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE
This brings us to our next point, knowing your target audience is KEY to content and marketing. AI is a tool to dive deep into analytics and relevant data such as trends.
Using the aforementioned ChatGPT, you can plug in a prompt such as “current marketing trends for Gen-Z” as a starting point to learn more about your audience and what appeals to them.
Integrating the AI’s knowledge helps you craft a strategic marketing strategy to align with the people that matter the most to your business.
3. QUALITY ASSURANCE
AI takes content creation to the next level through quality-checking tools. Say you need some
help writing a new blog post
, AI can proofread your writing and generate copy as well. But, don’t forget to be wary when using AI generated content! Here are some things to avoid.
Don’ts
1. COPY AND PASTE
AI is not a flawless machine, and it’s important not only to you, but your audience, that information is accurate. It’s your responsibility to at least fact check the content you share. Along the same lines, don’t be afraid to edit your work enough to surpass AI-written checkers. It’ll benefit you in the long run. Read more about using AI checkers and tools by
clicking here.
2. VIOLATE PRIVACY
Protecting private information is important to every person and is key to establishing trust. It’s important to prioritize privacy above all else! This means avoid feeding AI sensitive data (like student information) without consent. You can never be too certain where that information will go next.
3. LOSE YOUR VOICE
As groundbreaking as it is, AI can not take the place of a human who understands cultural context, tone, and emotions. A human audience wants to hear from other people! Don’t let AI take over your business, but use it to balance and uplift your content! It’s intended to be a tool and teammate, not the ruler."

Did you know that heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the United States and globally? With February marking American Heart Month, there’s no better time to promote ways to keep your heart healthy.
One of the best ways to keep your heart healthy is to engage in martial arts training. Making it a habit to step on the mat can make your heart run smoothly and more efficiently, leading to a longer and improved life.
Raised Heart Rate and Activity
Whether it’s kicking and striking during Taekwondo or grappling during BJJ, when you take part in a martial arts class your heart rate is going to rise. Your heart is a muscle and must be worked to stay healthy and strong. Increasing your heart rate makes your heart work harder to pump blood and oxygen throughout your body. This leads to many more benefits, including improved endurance and overall cardiovascular health. It also helps burn calories, in turn encouraging and facilitating weight loss.
Improve Blood Circulation
With the many dynamic moves in martial arts, including kicks and punches, your aerobic exercise time increases. This raises the heart rate and gets the blood flowing better in your body. Improved blood circulation allows the heart to operate more efficiently as well as providing the necessary nutrients to the rest of your body.
Lowers Blood Pressure
One of the leading causes of heart disease is hypertension, also known as high blood pressure. When you work out, including while practicing martial arts, your heart gains more and more strength. This helps the heart pump blood more efficiently, which in turn lowers blood pressure. The negative effects of high blood pressure go well beyond the heart, including potential damage to the eyes, kidneys, and brain. This makes avoiding it that much more important, and martial arts can help!
Reduces Stress
Heart health and stress levels have a direct link with each other. The mental health benefits that can be gained from martial arts are well known and celebrated among those who train. The focus, engagement, and community aspects of martial arts can help you take your mind off daily annoyances and problems, improve self-image, and ultimately decrease your stress levels. Reducing stress will help your heart improve glucose control and even lower cholesterol.
Lowers Cholesterol
Another lead cause of heart disease is high cholesterol. High cholesterol can greatly damage your heart, building up plaque in your arteries and then blocking or restricting blood flow to your heart. By regularly participating in martial arts classes, you can lower your cholesterol as you lose weight, which increases your healthy cholesterol totals and lowers the unhealthy cholesterol. Some consistent activity can greatly improve your cholesterol levels and steadily help you increase your overall health.

What are backlinks anyway? Well, simply put, backlinks are a link on a third-party website that leads to
your
website. But more importantly: high-quality, relevant, local backlinks are a crucial component of SEO. They help establish authority for your
martial arts school’s website
, which sends signals to search engines like Google that you should be pushed higher up in organic search rankings.
But the process of generating local backlinks can feel daunting – there’s simply no magic wand for building them (don’t trust those sketchy online backlink generators, they’re usually just spam and can hurt your site!) and it can take some time and manual effort.
But we’re here to make it much simpler. Read on to view our expert guidance (a Backlink Bible, if you will) on where to start, your best opportunities for backlinks, and how you can keep building them long after your site is launched!
Better Business Bureau
By listing your school on the Better Business Bureau website, you’re killing two birds with one stone: getting a solid backlink to your site and adding an extra layer of legitimacy to your business. And the best part?
It’s free!
Getting started is incredibly easy. Just
visit this page
and enter your school’s information. Even if your school is already listed, make sure to claim your listing so you have direct access to update your profile with new information as needed!
Your local Chamber of Commerce
You’d be hard-pressed to find a Chamber of Commerce website that doesn’t have a thorough directory of member businesses in the city. While you may have to pay a small annual fee to join your city’s Chamber, it’s an investment that can prove to be well worth it. Along with a strong, relevant local backlink to your martial arts school, most Chambers offer additional marketing benefits that can help long-term: newsletter placements, networking opportunities, event sponsorships and more.
Use this
handy directory
to find your local Chamber of Commerce site or simply Google “
Your city name
Chamber of Commerce
” and check out membership details and benefits. Most will let you apply online to get started!
Your local travel/tourism websites
At first glance it might seem odd to list your school on a tourism website, but hear us out! While these sites may have a primary focus on visitors instead of residents, they are often considered strong online authorities for their respective locations. And if you’re a Jiu-Jitsu school, you know that drop-ins from out-of-towners can happen on a regular basis! Plus, many tourism sites have event calendars, adding a second opportunity for you to share what’s happening at your school and generate a backlink to your website.
If there’s not a direct way to request being listed, find their Contact Us page and let them know you’re interested in placement on their site as an opportunity for visitors and residents alike to better themselves through martial arts.
Community publications
In an increasingly digital world, many printed publications are now leaning heavily on their websites to share community information. As a couple examples, here in the Kansas City area we have
The Pitch
and
Johnson County Post
. Both of these have a heavy focus on highlighting local businesses, including openings, events, and even directory pages. On a larger scale,
City Lifestyle
has localized publications throughout the country, including digital directories of businesses that have been highlighted in their issues. These publications also typically have annual ‘Best of’ contests that can offer a huge opportunity for your school as residents vote on their favorite local businesses.
Take some time to pinpoint your local community publications, and do some outreach to see how you can be listed on their sites. And don’t hesitate to contact them again when you have news to share – new programs being added, belt testing events, notable tournament results, etc.
Parenting sites/Kids activity guides
It’s a simple fact – parents are constantly trying to find new opportunities and activities for keeping their kids busy and entertained. Enter the vast world of parenting websites. Most of these are operated locally, and sometimes in a blog format, but no matter how they are built they are a valuable resource for martial arts schools that offer kids programs.
Need help finding your local sites? Try Googling the phrases “
things to do with kids in
your city name
” or “‘”
Your city name
kids activities
“. You should also
submit your directory listing information to MacaroniKID
. This is a national site with independent publishers across a ton of locations across the country. On their homepage, click ‘Find Your Community’, put in your zip code, then select the appropriate MacaroniKID community. Once there, find the Directory button, and you’ll be taken to the Business Directory page where you can submit your directory listing info!
Homeschool network sites
Along with kids martial arts programs, we know many of our clients offer classes specifically catered and promoted to homeschooled children. There are tons of websites out there serving as resources for parents of homeschooled kids, giving them ideas for field trips, events, and activities, including fitness and sports. Here in the Kansas City area, Midwest Parent Educators is an example of such a site, and they even have a
dedicated page for athletic programs
.
To find relevant homeschooling sites in your area, try Googling the phrases “
Your city name
homeschool groups
” or “
Your city name
homeschool network
”. Along with websites, you may also stumble across Facebook groups where these communities of parents interact and share with one another. This could be a secondary opportunity for your school – if they allow it (always make sure to check a Facebook Group’s rules), you may be able to share your class and event information with them through social media as well!
Yelp
Although you might hear Yelp and immediately think of restaurant reviews, don’t discount the impact that a Yelp backlink can have on your school’s website. Yelp is considered a highly reliable online directory – they estimate that around
2.5 million people
visit their site each day to find a business, and visitors contributed
21 million reviews
in 2024. If you haven’t set up or claimed your Yelp profile, now’s the time!
Click here to get started.
NextDoor
Sure, sometimes NextDoor can just feel like a place for people to ask about a strange noise they heard in the middle of the night or air their petty neighborhood grievances. But, it’s also a great place for a community to discover local businesses, and for your martial arts school to set up a business profile with a backlink to your website. If you haven’t done it yet,
click here to start getting yours set up
.
Martial arts-specific directories
If you’re part of a national martial arts association like
ATA
, then you should already be on their school directory with a backlink to your website. BUT, it can’t hurt to double check and make sure you are properly listed! Beyond associations, there are other directories that are worth checking to make sure you’re taking full advantage of backlink opportunities.
Jiu-Jitsu schools who are part of the IBJJF should verify placement on their
registered academies directory
. And if you’re not registered with them yet, you can fill out a request
here
to be added.
Another Jiu-Jitsu directory opportunity can be found at
Mat Made
. Kenny Kim has built out a phenomenal site populated with BJJ academies from all over the country, and you can
submit yours to be added for free
!
Community partners
Have you ever linked up with another small business in your community? Maybe it was to co-host an event, you raised money for a local non-profit, or you offered a special discount or class to a business or organization. In these scenarios (or any others you can think of), it’s more than appropriate to suggest a link exchange. Both you and your partners can update your respective websites to link to one another in the context of a blog post or even a partnerships page. It’s a win-win situation and just further strengthens the relationship you’ve already established.
Local news outreach
Remember how we mentioned the importance of continuing to build backlinks after your site has launched? This is where your local news stations and newspapers come into play. All of these media outlets have websites where they cross-post news stories were shared on-air or in print, or even post digital-exclusive news content.
You should be sharing information with your local news outlets on a regular basis.
What kind of things should you be sending their way?
Belt testing events and promotions
New programs being introduced
Specialized programs (LEO or first responder classes, special needs classes, etc.)
Community events that are open to the public (summer camps, guest seminars)
News from tournaments or competitions, especially if students had notable results
Specials you are offering (back to school)
If you move, expand or add a location
More information is always better, and be prepared to invite them to your school if they want to put you on a broadcast. They may not accept every time, but it’s worth trying!
Building out backlinks isn’t a fast process, but it’s well worth the time invested in creating listings and doing the community outreach to get your events and achievements highlighted. Just remember: if you approach your requests kindly, confidently, and with a strong belief in the value you bring to your community, it’ll be easy to convince organizations and businesses to spread the word!"

At Kicksite, we are always striving to provide best-in-class software for our customers. Often, this work results in updates and improvements that are easy to see: redesigned pages, new features, improved experiences, etc. Other times, these behind-the-scenes efforts are less visual, but equally important and absolutely necessary.
Next week, we will be rolling out authentication updates that fall into the latter category. While these updates won’t change a whole lot in terms of your everyday experience using Kicksite, they will ensure vastly improved security for all Kicksite users – admins, employees and students alike.
The quick summary of these updates?
Some Kicksite users will have their username automatically changed on Tuesday, September 27, 2022.
This includes not only student accounts, but also admin and employee accounts, and accounts used to access the check-in screen.
Why are some usernames being changed?
Up until now, duplicate usernames could exist across Kicksite, just not at the school level. For example: someone at School A could have the username
asmith
. Nobody else at School A could have asmith as their username, but someone at School B
would
be able to also use asmith as their username.
As part of this authentication update, starting Tuesday, September 27, 2022, duplicate usernames will no longer be accepted across the Kicksite platform as a whole. While there was/is no risk of users with duplicate usernames seeing each other’s information, this change greatly improves overall security and privacy for anyone accessing the software or member portal.
And, as an added bonus,
admins and students will no longer have to remember or enter their subdomain to log in to Kicksite
! All users can simply go to
www.kicksite.net
and enter their username and password, and they’ll be taken directly to their associated account.
How will my students, my employees and I know if we are affected by this update?
When the authentication updates are pushed live, an email will go out to all affected users letting them know that their username has been changed and showing them what their updated unique username is (see example below). They will also have the opportunity to click through to their My Account page and customize their unique username to something else, if they prefer.
Does this affect passwords too?
Nope! Your password will stay the same for now.
That being said, we are also implementing new password rules with this update. The next time any Kicksite user needs to reset their password, certain requirements will need to be met to ensure enhanced security.
What if I/my employees/my students don’t receive the email?
If you don’t receive the email on Tuesday, September 27, the most likely scenario is that your username did not require a change because it is already unique and not a duplicate. You may also want to check your Spam folder just in case the email landed there. And to be absolutely sure, you can log into your Kicksite account, go to your My Account page, and look under ‘Credentials’ to verify (or edit) your username.
My student can’t figure out how to change their own username. Can I do it for them?
You can! Admins now have the ability to update a student’s username from their Student Profile. Simply click the ‘User Account’ section in the Student Profile to expand it and edit that student’s username.
I still need help or have questions. What should I do?
If you run into any obstacles, our Success team is here to help! Just
submit a ticket

and we’ll be in touch."

Martial arts training can have a variety of positive effects for students. People who get involved with karate or tae kwon do can gain confidence and improve their physical strength. Children who start martial arts training at a young age may improve their grades because they learn discipline. These benefits can be stressed in a martial arts school’s marketing efforts to attract new students.
In addition to gains in self esteem, confidence and discipline, martial arts can be a valuable way for students of all ages to get more exercise and become stronger. People are leading increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and they can place their health at risk without exercise. Health guidelines call for kids and teenagers to exercise for at least 60 minutes per day, and many people are
not getting enough physical activity
, according to USA Today.
It’s important for parents to ensure their children are getting enough exercise, and martial arts training can be an effective way to do so, especially with the mental benefits.
Value of martial arts training for exercise and confidence
Some parents enroll their children in team sports in order for them to get exercise in a structured way, but this may not be enough physical activity for many. Much of the time kids are at practice may be spent listening to the coach rather than running around. Many children can benefit from individual sports, such as martial arts where the class size is smaller and they can receive more attention from an instructor.
In addition to helping kids incorporate more physical activity into their routines, participating in martial arts gives children the opportunity to compete and show off their new skills. This can give them a sense of accomplishment, USA Today said.
Although there are many benefits for children who participate in martial arts, students of all ages can gain new strengths and skills. Mixed martial arts is growing in popularity as a challenging way for adults to get into shape, NBC News stated. While mixed martial arts has traditionally attracted male students, women are getting involved. However, the sport can be dangerous and students need to have a qualified trainer who can help them avoid injury.
In addition to providing a unique way for people to get in shape, martial arts builds confidence and character. Children can learn discipline and adults can improve physical strength."

As we celebrate Black History Month in February, it’s important to look at history through all cultural angles. That includes those of us working in or participating in martial arts, as it’s not a frequently discussed aspect of Black History Month. When we look at mainstream martial arts and combat sports today, you can see the indelible stamp the African American and African communities have made over time.
Throughout history, boxers like Jack Johnson, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Muhammad Ali were some of the first African Americans fighters to become household names. That list has drastically expanded in recent years with Black fighters dominating in boxing, MMA, UFC, etc., cementing their place in the combat fighting landscape.
The Emergence of Martial Arts in the African American Community
Two historical events had a particularly strong influence on the growth of martial arts in the African American community: World War II and the Black Power movement. American soldiers returning from overseas during World War II came back to the States with a greater knowledge of martial arts like Karate and Judo. This led to a boom in martial arts training for African Americans thanks to veterans bringing back these lessons and spreading them to their communities.
After service members helped to build and establish that initial interest in martial arts, the Black Power Era movement in the 1960s and 1970s further expanded the impact. With the swelling resistance to racism and segregation, more and more individuals in the Black community dove into the world of martial arts as a means of self-defense and safety as tensions rose around them.
Growth Through Media
Martial arts’ overall growth in the United States was deeply influenced by Bruce’s Lee profound effect on Hollywood. That was especially true within the African American community, as they witnessed a person of color shining on the big screen. But it wasn’t just Lee who became a dual threat as an influential figure in show business and martial arts.
Jim Kelly starred alongside Lee in “Enter the Dragon” and became the first Black martial arts film star. He also starred in other films including “Black Belt Jones”, “Three the Hard Way”, and “Black Samurai”. Before he pivoted to a career in the film industry, Jim was an excellent and established martial artist. Most notably, he won four different Karate championships in 1971, including the World Middleweight Karate title at the Long Beach International Karate Championships. He also opened his own dojo in Los Angeles, which became a hotspot for celebrities and helped lead him on his journey to Hollywood.

Members of the Black Karate Federation
New Foundational Developments
Alongside the Black Power movement in the late 1960s came the creation of the Black Karate Federation (BKF) in 1969. The BFK was created by Grandmaster Steve Muhammad along with seven other martial artists in Los Angeles.
Possibly the most notable development from the BKF was the logo. The logo – featuring a cobra, fist, and the colors red, black, and green – was used to
acknowledge the Black Power movement as well as their African roots
. Muhammad and BKF co-founder Donnie Williams even appeared in a scene in Bruce Lee’s “Enter the Dragon” where they’re shown teaching a class with their logo in the background.
In addition to the creation of the Black Karate Federation, a new martial arts discipline was also created in the 1960s – Kupigana Ngumi. Formally established in Chicago by
Nganga Tolo-Naa, the style’s name means “way of fighting with fist” and encompasses various African fighting styles while also focusing on holistic refinement of mind, body, and soul. Intended to speak more directly to and motivate black youth at the time, the goal of Kupigana Nguimi was to integrate East Asian movement with modern cultural messages and deep lessons of African history.
Shane Jamil Hill-Taylor making history as the first IBJJF black belt world champion
Today’s Impact, Reach, and Influence
Today, Black fighters have greatly risen to the top in combat sports. Fierce and decorated competitors like Jon Jones, Floyd Mayweather, Israel Adesanya, and many more have become the iconic fighters of this generation.
That history is still being made. In 2018, Shane Jamil Hill-Taylor became the first African American International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF) black belt world champion. Even more impressive, Hill-Taylor achieved this milestone at just 20 years of age. In an interview with
Andscape
, he expressed his desire for this accomplishment to serve as inspiration for other others in the African American community who are looking to enter martial arts. “When I was younger, when I looked at all my favorite competitors and all my favorite black belt world champions, none of them were from the same background or from the same culture as me. So for me to be someone that could pave the way for another young kid to have someone to look up to, I think that’s very important, and that’s something I didn’t have besides my own teammates.”
Still, the presence of African Americans in the world of modern martial arts goes well beyond combat sports. Movies and TV shows have begun to show Black martial artist characters in prominent roles. Those include actor Michael Jai White (who holds 7 black belts across various disciplines) showing off his fighting skills in many roles, Denzel Washington in the “Equalizer” movies, Queen Latifah in “The Equalizer” tv-show, and Michael B. Jordan in the “Creed” movies. Michael added his own twist, making multiple anime references in Creed 2, adding another unique layer of martial arts relevance and reach thanks to the growing popularity of
shonen anime
in the African American community.
Nevertheless, as recently as 2021,
just over 10% of martial arts instructors are Black or African American
. While that percentage has remained fairly steady since 2010, we anticipate further growth with the continued expansion and popularity of martial arts and fighters like Hill-Taylor breaking new barriers.

In tandem with our “
A beginner’s guide to writing SEO-friendly blogs for a martial arts website
” blog, we decided to compile more resources to help with your blog writing process.
Blogs are one of the
best ways to drive traffic to a website,
are inexpensive, and they don’t have to take up too much of your time. They are especially quick and easy when you utilize tools and resources to aid in the writing process. With these resources, research, and your existing industry knowledge, you’ll establish your business’s expertise and improve website traffic in the process.
1. Keyword Research Tools
As mentioned in the previous blog post, writing about relevant content can improve search rankings. This leads to increased website traffic and improved SEO. By providing valuable information to current and prospective students, you’re also helping your website performance. You may be wondering which are the best keywords for your business to use, but there are plenty of free tools out there to help you identify them.
With a quick search, you can find numerous options for free keyword research tools. There are a lot to choose from, but here are some free options we recommend:
Wordstream
Ahrefs Keyword Generator
Moz Explorer
These sites will prompt you to enter a keyword (‘Jiu Jitsu’ or ‘Taekwondo’, for example) and then provide you with related keywords to improve for your business’s discoverability. These keyword lists typically account for search volume, competition, and ranking difficulty. From there, you’ll use those keywords to help guide your blog post topic, and consistently include those keywords as you write, bringing us to tool #2.
2. AI Writing & Checker Tools
With your new keywords, you have a starting point on what to input into AI writing tools, such as the famous
ChatGPT
. Take your suggested keywords as a starting point to generate and brainstorm topic ideas. From there, you can use the written output as a starting point for your blog post, with emphasis on “starting point”.
We repeat: don’t just drop AI generated content directly into your blog post!
Google has released an
official statement regarding AI-generated content and SEO.
In summary, while high-quality content is valued above all else, human-made content is prioritized over AI-generated content. This is where AI Checkers like
ContentDetector
come in handy. These tools help detect AI generated text. You can still utilize AI writing tools to create your foundation then simply edit, revise, and add details until your post is no longer flagged as AI. Together, this combination saves you a ton of time and preserves your search engine optimization.
3. Editing Software Applications
Whether you used the help of AI or not, it’s time to edit your blog post! There are numerous free editing tools out there. From
Grammarly
to
Hemingway Editor
, you have a wide variety of editing applications to choose from. Some editing software also comes with the aforementioned AI writing assistant to provide further edits. This step of the process helps your writing come across clearly and provide value to the reader. Whether you’re an inexperienced writer or a pro blogger, everyone needs someone or something to proofread their work!
With this collection of tools and resources at your fingertips, hopefully the idea of writing blog posts doesn’t feel as daunting. With a little bit of effort and research, you can improve your SEO and website traffic many times over! Remember: if you’re a website services customer, the Kicksite team happily updates your website whenever you want changes, including the blog portion of your website. You can reach out to websites@kicksite.net to make updates once you’re ready to publish!"

February marks National Cancer Prevention Month. It’s a time to raise awareness about cancer risk factors, causes, and the lifestyle choices that can be made to reduce chances of developing cancer. According to the
American Association for Cancer Research (AACR),
about 2 million Americans were diagnosed with cancer in 2024, and over 30% died of the disease. Even so, the fight against cancer is hardly a hopeless endeavor. Research has shown that more than 40% of cases are linked to preventable habits and causes including smoking, excess body weight, physical inactivity, and other variables.
These numbers are one of many reasons why we’re proud to partner with Tap Cancer Out and help with the fight against cancer through the martial arts community. You may remember our

Global Grappling Day is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to Tap Cancer Out raising money to benefit cancer-fighting organizations. Throughout the year, they also host Jiu-Jitsu tournaments across the country that serve as fundraising channels and allow competitors to gather donations in lieu of an event registration fee. In 2025, these donations will be dispersed to a variety of beneficiary organizations like Alex’s Lemonade Stand, the American Brain Tumor Association, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

Since 1963, National Small Business Week has taken place during May, celebrating the contributions and importance of small business owners and entrepreneurs in the United States. Since then, that celebration has expanded and May is now recognized as Small Business Month. With tens of millions of small businesses serving as the backbone of this country, it only makes sense for an entire month to be dedicated to their importance! There are a number of ways your gym or martial arts school business can celebrate Small Business Month in 2025, including education and promotional opportunities. Read below as we outline some of the things you should take advantage of!
See what your local Chamber of Commerce is planning
Your local Chamber of Commerce is a great place to connect with your community during Small Business Month and beyond. We recommend first checking out their calendar of events to see what they have planned. The Chamber may be planning specific Small Business Week/Month events, or they may have recurring events that provide a great way for you to engage. For example, our local Overland Park, Kansas Chamber of Commerce has a monthly Wednesday Wake-Up networking coffee event for small business owners. If you’re not yet a member of your local Chamber of Commerce, Small Business Month may be the perfect time to see if it’s a good fit for your gym or martial arts school! Need help finding your Chamber of Commerce?
Check out this helpful directory.
Attend free virtual Small Business Month events throughout May
There are plenty of free virtual events being offered throughout May! The U.S. Small Business Administration has a
convenient directory
that could prove to be helpful for a small business needing guidance. A variety of topics are covered, including financial wellness, intellectual property basics, and even employee retention. You can even narrow it down by your district office and meeting type. Check out the full list
here
for individual registration links.
Run a Small Business Month promotion
More than ever, buying local is top of mind for Americans as they choose how to spend their money.
Recent data
shows that 70% of consumers support local businesses, and 82% of consumers say they would spend
more money
to support local businesses. Small Business Month is the perfect time to take advantage of these trends and remind your community that you are proud to be a small, locally-owned business. Consider running a special promotion through the month of May, with messaging focused on how prospects can celebrate Small Business Month by supporting your small business. This could be a discount, a referral bonus, or even a free trial offer. Whatever you choose, make sure you heavily promote on your social media channels, your website, and even more traditional methods like posters or clings in your facility’s windows!
Write a business plan to get organized
Writing and formulating a business plan is vital for every small business. Whether you’re just getting started or working to grow, a solid business plan will have you organized and ready to manage finances, marketing, and so much more. A few months ago we released a guide on
how to write a business plan
complete with links mentors, workshops, webinars, and our very own CEO’s advice.
Partner with other local small business
In a
webinar
we hosted with Nick and Catherine Mitria of Pure BJJ, Nick spoke about some of the successes they’ve seen partnering with other businesses through their local Chamber. They have participated in events like Wine Strolls, where a local winery set up shop in their academy (as well as other nearby businesses) and allowed members of the community to check out the school in a casual setting. Your local Chamber of Commerce can help you make similar connections, or you may already have a business in mind that would make a great co-marketing fit. Reach out to those business owners and discuss the opportunities for Small Business Month co-promotion. A simple poster exchange could go a long way, or map out a plan to promote one another on social media to reach untapped audiences in your area.
There are tons of opportunities to learn, network and promote your gym or martial arts school as a way to celebrate Small Business Month. We hope this list has given you some ideas for what you can do and how you can embrace the month of May to make your business better!"

Clark Gracie, owner of Clark Gracie Jiu Jitsu and the Gracie Allegiance Association, is a 3rd degree black belt under his Father, Grand Master Carley Gracie. He currently lives in San Diego, California as an owner and instructor, but you’ll also find him traveling to world wide competitions.
1.) What is your history and family history with Jiu Jitsu?
I originally started training jiu jitsu around 3 years old, probably like most Gracie’s, in our living room under my fathers instruction. My Father, Carley Gracie, is the 11th son of Carlos Gracie Senior. My Dad was the first one of the family to come and teach Gracie Jiu Jitsu in the United States in 1972. My grandfather Carlos was the first person to learn from the Japanese Champion, Mitsuyo Maeda, as a teenager and develop the Jiu Jitsu he learned into the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu we continue to learn today. I have done my best to follow my families tradition in representing myself and my family name by competing and teaching the art around the world.
2.) What is your favorite thing about being a gym owner, professor, and competitor?
I have to say, from a teacher’s perspective, the greatest reward is to be able to see my students perform the techniques that I teach them, especially the moves that I do. I have been very fortunate to enjoy teaching and have been invited around the world to do seminars, camps, and continue to grow my team internationally. This has given me the opportunity to connect and build relationships with amazing people around the globe.
3.) What technique is your favorite to use/teach?
Some of my favorite techniques are the Omoplata and Kimura submissions.
**If you do not know, Clark is famous for his use of these submissions, and has done many instructional series on the Omoplata and Kimura systems, which you can check out
here
.
4.) Who or what is your biggest inspiration?
My biggest inspiration is for sure the development and endless evolution of our art. I can never stop learning, and I can never find a dull moment.
5.) What are your favorite things to do outside of Jiu Jitsu?
I love spending time with my family, especially enjoying the great outdoors. Living in San Diego it is not hard to appreciate it.

On April 22, Visa and Mastercard adjusted their interchange fees for merchants. While the changes were based on purchase category, and certain types of small businesses saw a drop in rates, overall the adjustments represented an increase in the fees that retailers pay when credit cards are processed. So what does this mean for you and your martial arts school or gym? We’ll break it down.
What are interchange fees?
Let’s start with the basics. Interchange fees are additional costs that are tacked onto every credit card transaction in order to compensate issuing banks, pay for consumer rewards, and ensure anti-fraud measures. Retailers and merchants foot the bill for these additional fees, which generally represent a small percentage of the total amount spent during the transaction. That percentage is actually determined by a number of complex underlying variables like card type, business type, transaction type, etc.
So why are they being raised?
According to Visa and Mastercard, the need for the latest adjustment is rooted in the recent surge in e-commerce, particularly during the pandemic. In 2022, US online retail sales are expected to hit $1 trillion for the first time ever. Even further, there continues to be an overall shift from cash to credit – more than half of Visa customers surveyed in January said they expect to be completely cashless in the next decade. With the increase in card payments comes an increased need for cybersecurity and fraud protections, and that’s where the interchange fees come in.
Why is it valuable to continue accepting card payments?
Though it can be scary to see the words “fee” and “increase” in the same sentence, the sky is definitely not falling, and there’s an inherent benefit to accepting card payments, even in the wake of minor fee increases. As noted above, consumer preference continues to shift from cash to card, and e-commerce is seeing massive growth as people become increasingly comfortable with digital payment methods.
Further, as Bankrate’s Ted Rossman notes, there’s ample evidence that shoppers spend more when they use cards because parting with cash feels more painful. With this “out of sight, out of mind” mentality when it comes to card payments, setting up automated billing could be a valuable piece of your business’ retention strategy. And when it costs 5x as much to acquire a new customer vs. retaining an existing one, retention should be top of mind as you plan for the future.
What’s Kicksite doing about it?
For our billing services, Kicksite is proud to partner with BASYS Processing, a neighbor of ours right here in the Kansas City area. With an A+ accreditation rating from the Better Business Bureau and an intense focus on providing world class service, BASYS aligns perfectly with our own values here at Kicksite. We’ve been in close conversation with them in recent weeks and want to reiterate:
BASYS and Kicksite are committed to keeping your flat rate pricing program unadjusted. Because of the aforementioned interchange feeincreases, our cost to provide processing has increased and we’ve chosen to pass this cost as a part of access to our payment portal – iQ Pro.
BASYS and Kicksite are happy to leave your flat rate pricing program unadjusted as you grow your business – other merchant programs may increase these processing costs as you have more payment processing volume.
Access to the BASYS payment portal (iQ Pro) did not increase by $29; rather, it increased $14, making the total cost $29 per month.
Access to the BASYS payment portal (iQ Pro) via the Kicksite partnership continues to provide timely processing and access to industry leading rates.
While the increasing cost of payment processing is unavoidable, we appreciate our customers’ understanding and are committed to providing a program that will continue to be the most dynamic and competitive program on the market."

As a small business you spend a lot of time communicating, whether on social media, via email, or within the local community. With all the effort you put forth, you want to make sure your audience is seeing your work!
Email deliverability
or placement is the rate at which emails arrive in the recipient’s inboxes and is one of the most important metrics when analyzing email marketing. After all, there is no open or click rate when your content is sitting in the spam folder.
THREE PARTS OF DELIVERABILITY:
Identification
– This is what proves you are who you say you are. This is determined by things such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF),
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
, and Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC).
Reputation
– You establish a sender reputation that scores how trustworthy your emails are. Different organizations and internet service providers (ISP) may score you differently but more recipients marking you as a trusted sender shall work in favor of your sender reputation.
Content
– Make sure your content and messaging work together to deliver a quality experience to the reader. If they are engaged, they’re more inclined to open your email.
How to improve your email deliverability
Now that we’ve established an understanding of what affects email deliverability, we can ensure that you’re optimizing your school’s communications. Use these 5 best practices and tips to land your content into more inboxes today!
1. HAVE AN UPDATED EMAIL LIST
Permission to email a recipient is essential in marketing. But even then, permissions can expire! Inactive subscribers can hurt your deliverability by skewing your engagement metrics. To combat this and declutter your contacts, you can remove or suppress unengaged users or run a reconfirmation campaign.
2. MAKE UNSUBSCRIBING SIMPLE
It may seem counterproductive to allow your audience to unsubscribe, but it’s a blessing in disguise. Sending campaigns to an audience that wants to receive your emails will affect your metrics positively, such as increasing your opens and clicks. Offering an easy way to unsubscribe, such as a link at the bottom, helps boost your engagement and keep your email list clean. Not to mention, it’s better to have a smaller, engaged email list than a large one where you’re more likely to be reported as spam!
3. PERSONALIZE YOUR EMAILS
Quality content is key! Sending relevant content provides value to your customers. Consider what they care about most, such as training tips, community updates, and school news. Emails are sent in mass, but maintaining personal content will positively increase subscriber engagement, relationships with readers, and deliverability.
4. ENGAGING EMAIL HOOKS
Crafting the perfect email can be tricky and first impressions are made right from the jump. You want to catch your reader’s eye with an engaging subject line and headline. Implementing a call to action or hinting at the content inside are both simple ways to draw your audience into opening the email.
With these four tips, you can improve the quality of your email content while increasing your business’s email deliverability. Your content is valuable and deserves to be seen by as many eyes as possible, not wasting away in a spam folder!"

Unlike some other small businesses, martial arts schools need to attract and retain students by building personal relationships. It can be time consuming for instructors to attract new students while devoting their time and attention to their current classes. However, martial arts software can help!
Overall Benefits of Email Marketing
Although many martial arts school owners may see email marketing as outdated,communication is still a useful recruitment to interest new students.
According to a study from Custora, customer acquisition through email for retailers has increased in the past four years. This means martial arts schools can still use this technique to recruit new students and engage previous clients. Social media has a lower conversion rate than email.
Email marketing can complement other online campaigns. Martial arts studios can encourage people to subscribe on their websites. Owners need a list of relevant prospects before creating engaging content or sending out special promotions.
Benefits of email marketing to gain new students
While martial arts schools can use a blog on their website to deliver informative content, email communications is brief. Readers should get all the information from a quick message. Although emails can be different lengths based on target audiences, the message should have an engaging headline to encourage opens.
When potential students receive coupons for discounted classes, it allows them to try it out before they commit. Email marketing informs prospective students about why martial arts are a valuable pursuit.
Benefits of email marketing to previous students
On top of attracting new recruits, email marketing can help martial arts schools convince previous students to return. If people took several classes and stopped attending, the school can send them messages about the benefits of continuing their training.
Email marketing can help owners and instructors improve their personal relationships with their students."

Although marketing helps martial arts schools highlight what makes them unique, the best brand advocates may be the establishments’ employees. If workers are engaged, they will have a positive influence on customers, according to Technorati, a social media blog.
The article cited data from the National Business Research Institute, stating between 40 and 80 percent of customer satisfaction is based on interactions with employees. If workers have a positive attitude, students are likely to notice and may be more likely to recommend martial arts classes to friends.
Engaged employees share several characteristics. They believe in the work their companies do, want to make things better, are respectful and helpful to others and are willing to volunteer for extra tasks. These workers are more likely to reach out to customers, as well.

Social media has more influence on potential customers’ decisions to buy a product or enroll in martial arts classes. While people may be interested in what brands say about themselves on Facebook and Twitter to a certain extent, prospects really want to know what other customers think. Technorati said people trust recommendations from other consumers up to five times more than what companies say about themselves.
Since social media is more common, employees may be using these networks to talk about work. If each worker has a few hundred connections across various channels, there is a lot of potential for them to influence others. Engaged employees can positively impact potential students’ perceptions of the school, but negative comments could detract from a strong brand image.
Karate and tae kwon do are involved activities, and instructors and other employees play a significant role in students’ experiences. Cheerful workers can function as brand advocates and positively influence enrollment at the school."

There are many types of bullying: verbal, physical, covert and cyberbullying. Children who face this type of torment often feel powerless and weak. Learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu will not only give kids the mental strength, but also the means to defend themselves against bullies.
A recent study conducted by Parentdish found bullying is still a major problem, and children are going much further than name calling. The brutality that some kids face can lead to serious self-doubt and anxiety that can affect their development.
For example, one 17-year-old shared how her bullies have crossed the line. She admitted that bullies were constantly hitting, kicking, spitting at her, pulling her hair across the playground and one even broke her foot. Another 16-year-old girl simply couldn’t deal with the verbal abuse.
“Verbal is for me the worst because things were said to me that I will never forget,” she said. “All the bullying that was inflicted on me was bad though and I felt powerless against it. It resulted it me self-harming and being depressed. I was broken.”
Children have to tell someone
More than 93 percent of parents answered that they feel comfortable talking about bullying with their kids. This is the first step to recovery. Parents have to take bullying seriously and understand how it effects their children.
“For anyone who suggests that ‘bullying is just part of life’, I’d invite them to read some of these heart-breaking responses and ask themselves is that really what anyone would want their child to go through?” said Tamsin Kelly, editor of Parentdish.
BJJ enables children to face bullies head on
Fighting is never a solution, but that doesn’t mean kids shouldn’t learn some self-defense techniques that will cause bullies to think twice before messing with them. Parents should think about enrolling their children in BJJ school. Kids can build up their self-esteem, while also learning how to overcome any other problems they face in the future.
With a renewed sense of confidence, children are able to ensure that they are no longer bullying victims. Rising up against bullies is the first step in the development of children who were once scared to go to school and put themselves out there."

Kicksite’s hometown NFL team, the Kansas City Chiefs, have once again made the Super Bowl (sorry all non-Chiefs fans)! The berth marks the fifth appearance in seven years with countless players contributing to help form a modern day football dynasty. Two of those young champions have discovered the benefits of training Jiu-Jitsu thanks to the combined tutelage of a Kicksite customer and a former Chief great, helping them discover a new form of conditioning and supporting a potential three-peat.
Chiefs defensive end and 2024 team sack-leader George Karlaftis was drafted in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Shortly after making the NFL, Karlaftis reached out to former Chiefs outside linebacker Tamba Hali for any professional advice that might help him succeed as a professional football player. Hali’s response? An invitation to join him on the mats.

April 6, 2023
The three-time Pro Bowler brought Karlaftis to train with him and
Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Overland Park
Chief Instructor (yes this is his real title, but also a helpful play on words here!) David Smarr. Under the mentorship of Smarr and Hali, Karlaftis (who had previous Wrestling and Judo experience) began his BJJ journey after his rookie season. He
credited the training for helping him to better understand physical leverage
during gameplay as well as bringing about humbling lessons related to defeat.
Since diving into the world of Jiu-Jitsu, Karlaftis has collected 18.5 sacks in the past two seasons and has become a staple for the Chiefs defense. Seeing the success of his first Chiefs “student”, Hali reached out to another yet another youngster on the team, this time a defensive lineman.
Felix Anudike-Uzomah was drafted by the Chiefs in the first round, one year after Karlaftis. As part of a position group with lots of depth, Anudike-Uzomah initially found little playing time as a young player during his rookie season. Since then, he’s joined Hali, Karlaftis, and Smarr on the mat to unlock all the benefits Jiu-Jitsu has to offer.
The Kansas State alum and KC native showed progress in his second year, doubling his tackle total and going from half a sack in 2023 to 2.5 in 2024. Along with his regular season growth, he collected a sack in the Chiefs 23-14 Divisional Round victory over the Houston Texans.
Coincidentally enough, Anudike-Uzomah wasn’t the only student of Jiu-Jitsu to make an impact in that particular postseason victory. Karlaftis also recorded a game-high 3 sacks against the Texans. He continued that 2024 postseason run by adding 2 tackles and applying notable pressure on Buffalo Bill quarterback Josh Allen in the AFC Championship Game 32-29 victory on January 26.
Whether the Chiefs win or lose the Super Bowl, the disdain many others have for the team and fanbase isn’t likely to vanish any time soon. At the very least, we hope that these players’ dedication to martial arts will at least earn them a little respect from the Jiu-Jitsu community. We expect Hali, Karlaftis, Anudike-Uzomah, and David to continue training BJJ with each other, and are looking forward to seeing how that translates to on-field play for Karlaftis and Anudike-Uzomah. The values and unique physical lessons from Jiu-Jitsu may very well help the Chiefs become the first ever back-to-back-to-back Super Bowl Champions.

As a small business gym owner with plenty on your plate, outranking your competitors on search can be a long and time-consuming process, especially if you’ve got a newer website. Moving up in organic rankings can take time! One of the most effective ways to get immediate visibility at the top of Google Search results by getting started with Google Ads.
While a digital ads strategy doesn’t necessarily make a major, direct influence on your organic search placement (since these are paid clicks), it
will
keep your gym showing up alongside your competitors, right at the top of search results –
if
they’re done right.
Google Ads is a paid search tool that lets you strategically place your site at the top of search results with full control over your headlines, keywords, location radius, and even custom audiences. You choose
where
you want to show up,
when
you want to be seen, and
what
kind of results you’re aiming for!
Start with a custom landing page
The first step before getting started with Google Ads is making sure you’ve got a clear and focused landing page that’s directly linked to your ad. Instead of sending people to your main website, having a dedicated page just for your Google Ads helps you do two things:
Track exactly where your leads are coming from
Give users a smoother, more focused experience tied to the specific promotion or offer you’re running
This landing page can still live on your main site, it just shouldn’t be searchable organically. It should match the look and feel of your brand: same colors, logos, fonts, and overall vibe. Think of it as a more streamlined version of your site, with multiple Call to Action buttons throughout to drive results.
It’s also important to make sure that the content of the landing page matches the content of your ads. Google will evaluate the landing pages that ads link to in order to determine how relevant they are. In turn, they then decide if your ads are a proper result to show to people searching the keywords you’ve built out (more on that later).
So what should your landing page include?
Header with strong CTAs
(Pull your prospects in right away—think “Try a Free Class Today” or “Claim Your Offer Now”)
Your Programs
(What do you offer? What ages and skill levels do you serve?)
A Special Offer for Leads
(Use a martial arts software like Kicksite integrated into your landing page to collect and track leads and tie it directly to the promotion you’re running)
Your Schedule
(Let prospects see class times and availability at a glance)
Testimonials
(Highlight real reviews from current members to build trust and provide social proof)
Footer with Contact Info + Main Site Links
(Include phone number, email, address, and a link back to your main site)
Build out your keywords and headlines
So, what’s a Google Ads keyword?
A keyword is basically a word or phrase you plug into your campaign that helps your ads show up when someone searches for those terms. Think: “martial arts gyms near me” or “self defense programs.” These are the terms your potential clients are already searching for, and your ad needs to be right there when they do.
To get started, you’ll need a wide variety of keywords. Of course, you’ll want to include the obvious ones related to martial arts and fitness. But don’t stop there! Think bigger, what else might your target audience be searching for? Things like “after school activities” or “programs for homeschooled kids” can bring in leads who aren’t directly searching for martial arts but still fit into your core audience.
Remember, keywords can, and should, change based on the season, the campaign, and the landing page the ads are driving to. If you’re running a summer camp promo, make sure to include terms like “summer camps near me” or “kids summer activities.” Tailor your keyword list to match whatever offer you’re pushing.
And don’t forget about location-based terms. Including your city or neighborhood in your keywords (like “Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Anderson, SC”) helps make sure you’re reaching people in your area who are actually ready to take action.
Now let’s build out some headlines!
You’ve got your search keywords locked in, now it’s time to build out your custom headlines. These headlines should align closely with your keywords, meaning they need to be relevant to what your potential prospects are actually searching for, and the content that is on the landing page you built out.
Make sure to include your location, any current promotions, and attention-grabbing phrases that speak directly to your audience. Think of your headlines as mini billboards, they need to stand out and make someone want to click.
Here are a few examples:
“Your First Class is Free”
“Women’s Self Defense in Anderson”
“Voted #1 Gym in Anderson”
“Fitness Programs for All Ages and Levels”
The goal is to create headlines that match the search intent and immediately show users that you have what they’re looking for, right in their area.
Location + conversion tracking
Having a designated radius around your location ensures you’re targeting the immediate area that your gym actually serves. In more populated areas, be mindful of how far your ads should really extend (how far are people actually willing to drive to train at your gym?). If there are spots within that radius you’d rather not target, consider using zip codes instead. You don’t want your ad budget going toward areas that aren’t relevant to your school.
When it comes to tracking, make sure your Google Ads account has a process in place to track conversions properly. Lead submission forms and phone calls are two of the main ways to do this. Use a tool like
Google Tag Manager
to implement your Google Tag code on your site and set up a trigger for tracking.

How is your martial arts school preparing for the holidays? If you aren’t discounting classes for new students or creating email marketing campaigns in the spirit of the season, it’s important that you figure out a way to market the school in the upcoming months.
One idea is to make gift cards
that family members or friends can buy for one another that can be put toward classes or training sessions. Not only can this strategy boost attendance numbers, but it can also help Americans who are looking to find an easy present to buy.
Gift cards are a popular choice this holiday season
Let’s say a friend mentioned that they would like to start learning martial arts, but it’s hard to find out which class would work best for them. This is why gift cards can be a simple option for shoppers who want to make their loved ones happy.
A new study from Prosper Insights & Analytics on behalf of the National Retail Federation revealed holiday shoppers plan to spend more than $163 this year on gift cards on average, and total spending is expected to reach nearly $30 billion. With the gift card market thriving, martial arts school owners should pounce on the opportunity.
“Shoppers today recognize gift cards as the perfect fool-proof option for friends and family,” said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the NRF. “And traditional gift cards aren’t the only winners this holiday season, as more and more Americans are tied to their mobile devices, we expect digital gift cards to be especially popular with consumers.”
Get gift cards in the hands of consumers
So you’ve produced some gift cards and you’re ready to send them out to shoppers, but you don’t know how to sell them. An article for Practical Ecommerce has the solution to this problem. Offer gift cards at a discount.
Martial arts school owners are more likely to garner interest from consumers if they feel like they’re getting a deal on the gift card. For example, allowing people to buy a $100 gift card for $90 will dramatically increase the chances that they buy it for a loved one. The secret to making the most out of gift cards is growing attendance numbers in classes at the school without hurting overall profit margins."

Online shoppers are inundated daily with social media posts, search results, and other pieces of content begging them to spend their money. It can be harder and harder to break through that noise organically. In an effort to rise to the top (literally and figuratively!), digital advertisements are a crucial tool for all businesses, including martial arts schools. Utilizing this form of marketing provides you and your school the opportunity to present your brand to people who may not have seen you otherwise and reach a larger audience.
The more your online presence grows, the more potential leads you gain and the more students you could see walking in your doors and signing up for your programs. The two most common forms of digital ads for local businesses are Google Ads and social media ads. But they each have their own unique nuances, structures, and benefits, so it’s important to understand the differences.
How Google Ads Work
Google ads are advertisements that are shown solely to targeted audiences in their search results page, and allow them to click through to your website to make a purchase or fill out a lead capture form. These audiences are targeted based on demographics, location criteria and, most importantly, keywords. Using a variety of match types, the Google Ads system allows you to build a list of keywords or phrases related to your business. These can be single words like “Taekwondo” or more detailed, long-tail phrases like “best Taekwondo school in Cleveland.” You can also create a list of keywords and phrases you DON’T want to target, in order to prevent people who aren’t relevant shoppers from seeing and clicking your ad (and in turn, using up your ad budget).
This type of granularity means your ads are especially likely to reach active buyers who are researching or shopping for a martial arts school. But it also means that Google ads are hardly a set-it-and-forget-it solution. It’s important to continuously monitor and make adjustments to your keyword lists and other components to maximize your results. Google ads are almost exclusively text based, so it’s crucial that you’re making the most of the headlines and ad copy, using language that is likely to hook potential leads and convince them to click your ad.
Google Ads Benefits
More likely to reach active shoppers who are ready to fill out a form or sign up immediately
Keyword and negative keyword granularity helps prevent ad budget being spent on irrelevant audience
Larger overall audience to reach
A pay-per-click (PPC) advertisement
Only pay when someone clicks on your add
Website connectivity for improved data
Set up tracking and triggers to monitor conversions and ad campaign performance
Ad strategy flexibility
Can edit and adapt your advertisements on the fly, both through automated and manual refinement
Increase website traffic
Even if ad visitors don’t convert immediately, they have an increased likelihood of returning to your website later
Ability for users to call your business through ads
How Social Ads Work
Social media ads are advertisements that appear as sponsored posts in users’ feeds or other areas on these apps like Facebook’s desktop sidebar and Messenger. Whether the advertisement is posted on Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok, or whatever hot new platform pops up, it can target specific demographics and audiences. This targeting isn’t quite as nuanced and detailed as what you’ll find on Google. Rather than setting up highly specific search phrases, social media ads typically allow you to target based on interests, profile data, or pages that a user likes. While it may not be as detailed as what Google allows you to do, it still presents unique opportunities to layer interest targeting to find the right audience. For example, you could target users with an interest in Jiu-Jitsu who are parents of kids between a certain age in an effort to promote your youth BJJ classes.
While your social media ad targeting may not be always hitting active shoppers like on Google, there is one major benefit to social media ads: creative freedom. While Google’s search ads are almost solely text-based, social media ads allow you to share and promote visual content that grabs the eye of the viewer and tell your school’s story while promoting your programs and classes. So, while someone may not be directly searching to find a Jiu-Jitsu academy near them, a killer video just might convince them to check yours out!
Social Ads Benefits
Can use multiple platforms with different features
Facebook, X, Instagram, etc.
More creative freedom in ad creation
Ads can include photo, video, a carousel of photos, or even full visual interactive experiences
Rotate seasonally to keep ads fresh
Robust Call to Action button options
Social ads can drive to a website, but they can also populate instant forms within the app, allow users to make phone calls, get directions to your business, or send your school’s page a direct message
Layer social activity targeting criteria to build audiences
Using demographics, behaviors, and interests based on social activity
Don’t require a website/landing page in order to run ads
Can retarget users who have previously interacted with your school
Help grow your social following
Advertise events that you’ve created on Facebook
Getting Started
with Google or Social Ads
Taking the plunge into digital advertising can feel daunting. Regardless of the platform, launching and managing ads can be a time-consuming endeavor, and time is likely something you don’t have a surplus of!

sites, because AI Overviews include links that ultimately could
get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing.
So what does this mean for your martial arts school? Is the sky truly falling on Google search? Is it just a momentary panic and nothing to actually worry about? Like most things, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Fortunately, for small businesses like yours, there are some easy things you can do to make sure you are still discoverable to potential new students, even with the rollout of AI Overviews.
Keep Your Google Business and Maps Profile Updated
In one of the AI Overview examples that Google shared, someone enters the prompt
“
find the best yoga or pilates studios in Boston and show me details on their intro offers, and walking time from Beacon Hill.”
AI Overview proceeds to present the user with a side-scrolling list of options, including an image, Reviews overview, distance, and intro offers for each studio.
The importance of Google Business and Google Maps Profiles for local businesses cannot be understated.
For your martial arts school, local search is a key method for gaining visibility and leads. Keeping your Business and Maps Profiles updated with pictures, current offers, accurate contact information and hours, etc. is absolutely necessary, even without the introduction of AI Overviews. Google is also introducing revamped business performance data for these Profiles, including recommendations for how you can improve.
Did you know you can also add posts to your Google Business Profile, just like on social media? This is a great, free way to promote your new programs, offers, and keep people updated on what’s happening at your school.
Not sure where to start? Here are some resources and guides:

Gather Google Reviews from your students
As mentioned in the above scenario, the total number of Reviews and average Review score are one of the key pieces of information shared in AI results that include business listings.
So here are the key questions: Do you know how many reviews you currently have? Are you actively encouraging your students to leave positive reviews for your school?
If the answer to one or both of these is No, then it’s a great time to do a Review campaign with your students. Google makes it incredibly easy to drive customers to leave a review: when you’re signed into the Google account associated with your Business Profile, and are viewing your Reviews, you’ll see a ‘Get more reviews’ button at the top. Click this and a window will pop up with a custom link that you can share with students to take them directly to the review form.
If you’re a Kicksite user, our Communication tools make it incredibly easy to share this. Drop it into an email or text blast and let students know how much you’d appreciate their positive review so others can discover the school and join your community.
(While you’re here and we’re talking reviews, we sure would love it if you took a few minutes to
leave Kicksite a review
!)
Keep your website current and informative
While the introduction of AI Overviews may present a clickthrough obstacle for some websites, the websites still have to exist for AI Overview to develop answers! Now more than ever, you should be working to ensure that your martial arts school’s website is thorough, informative, and up-to-date.
Why?
Well, in short, Google likes sites that are:
Relevant: Sites that include keywords that are part of the search
Quality: Sites that show expertise and trustworthiness
Usable: Sites that are mobile-friendly, load quickly, etc.
And luckily, you (yes, you!) are an expert about martial arts, and more importantly, your business! If you’re not already, you should be doing regular audits of your website to make sure all of your business information is up-to-date: offers, hours, events, program descriptions, etc. If you
haven’t
already been doing this, consider making it a regular, scheduled part of managing your business. On the 1st of every month, plan to look over your site and make sure everything is accurate and current.
Another aspect of maintaining your website that you should turn into a regular practice is blogging. As a martial artist and business owner, you have a wealth of knowledge to share. And by consistently writing relevant blog posts, you’ll be more likely to be ranked, selected, and highlighted for your expertise relevancy.
Now you might be saying “I’m not a writer, I’m an instructor/grappler/athlete/(insert other thing)!” That’s okay! You don’t have to be a writing expert to craft effective blog posts. We’ve covered this topic extensively in our own blog recently, here are some resources to check out:

If you’re a Kicksite Website Services customer, you can reach out to our website team at any time to send in content changes, blog post updates, or request any other revisions to your site to make sure it’s in the best shape possible.
The rapid growth of AI, and technology changes in general, can be scary! But at the end of the day, potential students will always be on the lookout for a school that is well-reviewed, displays martial arts expertise, and clearly communicates their benefits and offerings. By following the three recommendations above, you can consistently ensure all of these things!

Before any clients go to your website or sign up for martial arts classes, the first thing they’ll probably see is your Google Business Profile. This is likely their
first and
most important
impression of your business. It’s crucial – no, not crucial –
necessary
to build out your GBP the best you can for your martial arts school’s success. Take a look at how it affects your business and how to optimize it.
How your Google Business Profile Helps your School
Improves your Local SEO
Did you know that the contents of your Google Business Profile can impact your Local SEO? This includes where your website ranks on Google Search as well as how high your school is listed on Google Maps. There are a number of profile details beyond basic business information that can help your school appear higher (or at the top!) of these search results.
When someone in your area looks up “martial arts school near me”, “(
Insert City
) martial arts”, etc., Google is trying to find the most useful information and set of businesses to pull up. This is ultimately determined by a combination of distance, relevance, and prominence. Having accurate location information, including relevant keywords, and maintaining a great reviews rating can help shoot your Google Business Profile to the top of the ranks! This Local SEO impact is the greatest way your Google Business Profile can uplift your martial arts school.
Builds Credibility and Show Reliability
Along with Local SEO benefits, you can build valuable credibility from having a thorough Google Business Profile. If a customer sees just one photo, no description, and inaccurate information, what will they think of your school? Probably not much! They will move on to find a martial arts school that appears more buttoned up and forget all about your business.
That’s why building a strong and enticing Google Business Profile is so important. It’s an easy way to build customer trust and show your reliability. From your photos to customer engagement, each detail can tip the scale between a client diving deeper into your school or moving on in their search.
Provides Customer Engagement
Another great benefit of creating your Google Business Profile is the opportunity to build customer engagement. You should regularly encourage students to leave reviews, and reply to them on your Google Business Profile as well. This not only sends positive signals to people who are researching schools, but it can also help your ranking on search. Plus, you’ll receive feedback and insights that ultimately help your business thrive, grow and improve.
Additionally, you can engage with current customers and potential leads through your Google Business Profile Q&A section. This is a great way to preemptively answer questions prospects might have, but also allows them to contact you with anything else they are wondering. They can leave a question or call your school directly from your Google Business Profile to let you know how they are feeling about your business or get that last push they need to visit.
It’s also important to note: the more you engage with customers, the greater your credibility as a hands-on and community-based business grows in the eyes of potential customers.
Displays Your Business on Google Maps
A common way for someone to verify a business’s location is by checking Google Maps. By creating a Google Business Profile and providing your
accurate
address, you’ll appear on Google Maps for customers to see. If you’re a newer school, the photos on Satellite or Street View may not be up-to-date (but you can
report outdated imagery here!
), but your proper location will still appear on the aerial view. This is also a prime reason why it’s crucial to upload your own photo of the exterior of your business on your Google Business Profile.
How to Optimize your Google Business Profile
Submitting High-Quality Photos and Videos
As mentioned above, you can greatly improve your Google Business Profile with photos and videos. For starters, you should absolutely submit a photo of the outside of your business to show customers your location. From there on out, let your creativity run wild.
You can add a variety of photos and videos to show customers what your business is all about. Consider including photos/videos of both your empty facility and ‘action shots’ of classes taking place. Hosted a unique seminar event? Post a photo from it. One of your students dominated at an event? Post a podium photo or video on the mat. Held a summer camp? You get the rest. By adding these photos and videos, customers will see what your martial arts school has to offer and if it is a fit for them.
A few tips:
By “high quality” we don’t mean you need an expensive camera and to hire someone to take photos. You can, but your phone can get the job done just as well!
An easy way to show the inside of your business is to take a quick walkthrough video and post it on your Google Business Profile. It’ll make your business feel extra personable and gain trust with potential customers.
If you intend to post photos that include students’ faces, it’s always a good idea to have them/their parents sign a photo release giving you permission. Luckily, Kicksite makes it super easy to create and share a digital Photo Release Form through our
Agreements tool
!
Replying to Reviews
When someone leaves a review, good or bad, it’s important to acknowledge it. When someone leaves a positive review for your school, thank them and let them know you appreciate them training with you. If there is a negative review, make sure to figure out the context, reach out, and work to find a solution. It’s best practice to acknowledge and apologize for their frustration, and suggest connecting in-person or over the phone to resolve their issues.
Very rarely, you’ll receive a spam review or a competitor trying to lower your ranking. If this unfortunately happens to you, flag the review and submit it to Google. Google will review and remove it if it meets the right removal criteria.
Creating an engaging, keyword-driven description
As is the case with just about anything related to Google search results, SEO is an important piece of your Google Business Profile, and keywords play a significant role in that search engine optimization. Your Google Business Profile’s description is an ideal spot for strategically placing keywords, specifically in the first two sentences. Make sure to tell customers what type of martial arts school you are, where your school is located, and what classes you offer.
For example, if you are a Kansas City martial arts school offering MMA and Jiu-Jitsu you could use this as a baseline for your first two sentences: “(
Insert School Name)
is a Kansas City, MO martial arts school. We offer MMA and Jiu-Jitsu classes to students of all ages.”
Now, you’ll of course want to put your unique spin on it with your own highlights and differentiators, but take advantage of this easy way to boost SEO with keyword usage.
Keeping Everything Current
You should be scheduling out regular, frequent reviews of your Google Business Profile to identify pieces of information that need to be updated or changed for accuracy. If you have a change in business hours (see our note about holidays below!), location, name, etc., you’ll want to be sure it’s correct to stay honest with your customers. How unfortunate would it be if someone decided to visit for a walk-in and you were closed, despite your Google Business Profile saying you were open?
It is important to note, if you change certain key business information like your name and address, Google may require you to reverify your account. Be ready to do so in order to have full access to your account as soon as possible.
Review your Categories and Attributes
Categories and Attributes are a vital and often overlooked part of a Google Business Profile’s information. Categories are just what they sound like – you are able to choose from a massive list of business categories to classify what kind of business you run. BUT, too many businesses only select one! ‘Martial arts school’ is a no brainer for Kicksite customers, but there are so many more that could apply to you and your school:
Martial arts club
Self defense school
Sports school
Boxing ring
Weightlifting area
…and many others! Be sure to fully scour the available Categories and select all that apply.
Here’s a great resource
to browse and search the current list of available Categories.
Meanwhile, Attributes allow you to select unique characteristics that apply to your business. This includes:
Accessibility attributes like wheelchair parking
Crowd attributes like being family-friendly and kid-friendly
Ownership attributes like being minority-owned or woman-owned
…and a whole lot more. Like Categories, be sure to take time to peruse the full list of available Attributes and select the ones that are relevant to your school. These small details may be what seals the deal for future students!
Other Tips for your Google Business Profile
Always Update Hours for Holidays
Have you ever looked at a business to see if it was open for the holidays and saw “
Depends on Holiday Hours”
or “
_____ might affect these hours
“, providing no clear answer? Annoying, right? Make sure you don’t do that to your clients. Update your holiday hours (Google will send you a reminder email) so customers or potential visitors know for a matter of fact if you are open and what your hours are on those special days.
Show How you Stand Out
Every part of your Google Business Profile should show what makes your martial arts school special! If you are a top competition team, include it in your description. Have a state-of-the-art facility with tons of special features? Post photos and videos of every part of your gym space.
People want to know what makes your school different from everyone else’s. Don’t make them have to dive deep to find out what it is. Show it off proudly on the front screen so you can catch the eyes of all those looking to roll onto the mat!
Consistently Post
One of the features many businesses do not take advantage of is posting on your Google Business Profile. If you go to the “Add Update” section, you can post updates, offers, or events. Not only does it provide another way for clients to become intrigued, it is also another avenue to boost your SEO. So, if you have anything fun, exciting, or different happening at your martial arts school, post about it and show off who you are!"

What is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month?
In 1987, President Ronald Reagan
first recognized
March as Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month. Today, the effort is
still in full force
as this annual campaign is spearheaded by the National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities. Their aim is to unite individuals with and without disabilities, heighten awareness of individuals with disabilities, and show how they are contributing to their communities through work, school, and other activities.
What is considered a developmental disability?
As defined by the CDC, developmental disabilities are a group of conditions due to an impairment in physical, learning, language, or behavior areas. These disabilities typically begin during children’s early developmental periods and last throughout their lifetime. While not a comprehensive list, the most common developmental disabilities include:
ADHD
Autism spectrum disorder
Cerebral palsy
Hearing loss
Fragile X syndrome
Tourette syndrome
Although developmental disabilities can cause impairments or limits with physical or learning capabilities, it’s still crucial for these individuals to stay healthy, active and involved in activities. And you might be surprised at how common developmental disabilities actually are.
Recent estimates
suggest that around 17% of children between the ages of 3 and 17 have one or more developmental disabilities.
How can martial arts help kids with developmental disabilities?
As anyone who has taught or trained martial arts knows, the lessons in discipline, confidence, and physical and mental health are extraordinary traits for any child to gain. This includes children with developmental disabilities! Beyond the broad opportunities for growth and development, there are highly-specific benefits that can be gained for martial arts students with development disabilities:
Socializing and sense of community
Anti-bullying techniques
Coordination and motor skills
Improved focus and attention
Coping skills
Creating a program specific for children with special needs could provide them a unique opportunity that isn’t available through other martial arts schools or athletics programs in your area. With an inclusive, well-paced special needs martial arts program, they won’t fall behind from others or feel forced to move forward before they’re ready.
Rather, they can train alongside others who are facing similar challenges while feeling welcome and safe in a patient and understanding environment. They can all grow together and greatly improve their self-confidence and make life a lot easier in a time where many things could be a daily struggle.
A case study in creating a martial arts program for developmental disabilities
Bobby Pallen of
Pallen’s Martial Arts Tri-Valley
in Dublin, CA has been running his ‘All Abilities’ program for around 3 years. Before the program was created, Pallen had offered private lessons to a number of students with disabilities that ranged in severity and prevented them from being able to join group classes. As he conducted these private lessons, he always wished he could offer even more given the number of children who live with disabilities. Thanks to his longtime student-turned-instructor Cedric Novenario, whose daughter is Autistic, Pallen found a final push and source of inspiration to create an established program.
All Abilities
classes are specially designed for kids with disabilities, so they can discover the benefits of martial arts in an environment that is better suited to their needs and unique individual learning paces. They are group classes, but Pallen notes that they operate with a level of independence and freedom that is necessary for it to be successful. Parents are encouraged to step on the mats and assist with drills, and for students who might be considered ‘runners’, they are given the grace to go on and off the mats as needed.
While there’s freedom in the All Abilities program, it’s hardly a free-for-all. Pallen makes it a point to root these classes in the same martial arts curriculum he uses for his other programs. This martial arts core is supplemented by other physical activities, ranging from strength and conditioning to flexibility and reflex work. For example, one day he might set up heavy bags and have students dive into stick training, practicing striking the bags at different angles.  The lessons learned on the mats don’t stop there, either. Parents are provided with lesson plans to take home, and encouraged to do repetition work with students when they aren’t in class.
This focus on parent involvement, attention to detail, and the fine-tuned balance of structure and freedom have paid off. “I’ve had feedback from parents that there’s nothing like it around the area,” Pallen said. And the benefits go beyond positive reviews from moms and dads. Pallen has even been able to transition a handful of students into standard classes thanks to the growth and development they’ve experienced through the All Abilities program. Pallen hopes to further expand the program too – he dreams of making it bigger and is working to connect with local groups and organizations to secure funding for his work with students who have disabilities.
While the idea of creating a special program for students with disabilities may seem intimidating, Pallen stresses that there’s nothing to fear. Simply speaking with Cedric and using him as a resource was all he needed to have the confidence to create the All Abilities program. He encourages instructors to talk to parents of kids with disabilities to understand basic needs and wants, and fully grasp the main benefits that these parents are seeking.
You may not realize it, but you could be just a few conversations away from making a massive difference in your community for kids with developmental disabilities. Take inspiration from Bobby Pallen during Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month, and look into starting a special needs program at your martial arts school!

The everyday hustle and routines in life can be very stressful. And that’s not even taking into account the surprise moments that throw us for a loop and stretch us thin! It’s important to acknowledge your stress and what builds on your anxieties. Finding activities to participate in, such as martial arts, can be a great stress reliever. As National Stress Awareness Month is recognized in April, let’s take a look at how practicing martial arts relieves stress for people on and off the mat.
Improve Breathing
When engaging in a physical activity, your breathing pattern can make or break your experience. So, as you learn to breathe during martial arts, you are not just helping yourself on the mat but with your stress outside of classes.
Poor breathing techniques often prolong feelings of anxiety. Slow and controlled breathing helps improve your physical symptoms of anxiety and balances out your body. If you take your breathing skills learned on the mat and adapt them to other situations, you can calm yourself down and make stressful situations less mentally and emotionally taxing.
Confidence Building
One of martial arts’ greatest benefits is building self-confidence. Whether it’s confidence in your physical abilities, fitness, mentality, or anything else, you can carry that with you indefinitely for a more positive outlook on life. No matter what difficult challenge or situation you face, you can face it knowing that you are someone who is able to conquer obstacles. As you further find self-improvement, your confidence will grow and help your stress dissipate.
Releases Dopamine
The release of dopamine activates the reward system in your brain. Your brain then can provide greater focus and motivation to help you “lock in” for different situations. Martial arts releases dopamine through physical activity and the satisfaction of achieving goals. This healthy release of dopamine will provide you with a sense of joy and can help lower your sense of anxiety. Simply put – martial arts can improve your mood to lower your stress.
Acts As a Therapeutic Activity
Stress isn’t the only negative emotion people experience on a daily basis. Bottled-up emotions of anger, frustration, despair, etc. alongside stress can put you in a position where you’re desperate for a form of release. There may be no better release than martial arts. Whether you’re punching, kicking, grappling, or throwing, you can channel your worries and feelings into a productive activity that will chip away at negative emotions. That being said: it’s always important to not channel these emotions into hurting anyone you are training or sparring with, but to release them in a healthy way.
Friendship Building
There may not be anything that helps people’s
mental health
more than developing strong relationships with other people. Well, martial arts schools are one of the best places for that! You can join a community of different individuals all looking to become better people on and off the mat. The friendships you build on the mat can carry over outside of the school and add more positivity in your life.
A Break from Stressors
If nothing else, training in martial arts allows you to take a break. There are so many stressors in life – if you don’t take time to focus on something else, this stress can build in a bad way. Martial arts provides a time to be productive and disconnect from thinking about your anxieties. Locking in and focusing on a goal gives you a break to think solely about yourself and what’s happening on the mat. Just taking that self-care time and practicing martial arts relieves stress without you even thinking about it.
Martial arts can relieve stress, and Kicksite can relieve the stress of running a martial arts school! If you’re an owner or instructor who could use some help, our martial arts software just might be the answer for you.

Leadership.
It takes shape in many ways, forms, and styles. It’s a journey and evolution that changes you for the better. Whether you’re an experienced leader or starting to take that leap, CEO Jason Neef and the Kicksite Leadership Team have a few words of wisdom for you. From consistency to integrity, check out what our team values the most in a leader below!
Q: If you only had to pick one, what trait is the most important in a leader?
Jason, CEO ||
Consistency.
Ryan, CTO ||
If I had to pick just one trait, I’d say empathy is the most important in a leader. It forms the foundation for understanding and connecting with others, which helps build trust, respect, and strong relationships within a team. When leaders show empathy, they can better support their team members, understand their challenges, and create an environment where people feel heard and valued. This can drive motivation, engagement, and a sense of shared purpose, which ultimately contributes to the success of the team and the organization.
Pat, Marketing Team Supervisor ||
Adaptability. Nobody learns, grows, or works in the exact same way, so be a chameleon in how you communicate, guide and teach!
Chris, Sales Team Lead ||
I think the biggest trait to have as a leader is patience. Letting your co-workers develop with the tools that they are provided helps a team to focus without panic.
Cody, Customer Success and Support Team Lead
||
Empathy.
To be useful in my position it’s important to me that I always try to understand the experiences of my team and our clients.  I can’t lead and provide a good experience if I don’t understand the needs of the employees and clients around me that allow me to be here.
Travis, Website Team Lead ||
The ability to recognize where your staff needs more help, where they are excelling, and when they need to be pushed to achieve more.
Mike, Associate Sales Team Lead ||
Integrity is most important to me as a leader. Leadership requires trust and principles. If you can compromise your principles; then you aren’t leading, you’re following someone else’s.
Devin, Associate Support Team Lead ||
Integrity.
Alison, Associate Success Team Lead ||
I think Creativity and Empathy are most important in a Leader.  You need to be able to think outside of the box and listen to ideas that may initially seem a bit out there!  I think it is also super important to understand everyone you work with has their own lives and experience that affect their day-to-day.
Q: What advice do you have for other leaders or those growing into leadership?
Jason, CEO ||
Stop chasing the big idea, the overnight success, the get-rich-quick gimmicks. Instead, focus and commit to getting a little bit better every single day on the important objectives that bring value to your customers. Once you become a leader, coach your people to do the same. Success comes from patience, discipline and execution.
Ryan, CTO ||
As well as building strong connections with your team, I think it’s important to lead by example and commit to continuous learning. As a leader, your actions set the tone for the entire team, so it’s important to model the behaviors, work ethic, and attitude you want to see in others. At the same time, recognize that leadership is a journey of growth. Embrace learning opportunities—whether it’s through feedback, new experiences, or even mistakes —and use them to evolve as a leader. How you handle challenges and setbacks will show your team that growth is not about being perfect, but about adapting and persevering.
Pat, Marketing Team Supervisor ||
Becoming a leader isn’t an endpoint, it’s an evolution. Keep yourself open to continuous growth, change, and learning, including from the individuals you lead.
Chris, Sales Team Lead ||
It takes time for some to develop more than others. Be patient and provide guidance during tough times.
Cody, Customer Success and Support Team Lead ||
Have standards, constantly challenge those standards internally, and have hard conversations.  The hardest things about leading for me is finding the balance between rigid expectation and being too flexible.  My team expects me to provide them the roadmap of how to grow and excel.  If I’m too lackadaisical they have nothing to professionally orient themselves with.  If I’m too rigid I can stifle creativity and engagement, and the consequences if I’m wrong can erode trust and confidence people have in me.  Once you have those standards it allows you to have difficult conversations where growth can occur.  I can show someone how to improve.  How the team can improve.  I can be wrong and grow, myself.  If I can’t engage in a deep and meaningful way, even if it’s uncomfortable, we can’t expect to succeed.
Travis, Website Team Lead ||
Be aware of current processes and always be willing to change them. Find the root of any issues and start with adjusting that. Always look for ways to improve yourself and your team.
Mike, Associate Sales Team Lead ||
Advice for growing into leadership? My best advice is to recognize that leadership is an activity, not a title. Sometimes the most powerful leadership is demonstrated without having been hired or tasked with the direct responsibility.
Devin, Associate Support Team Lead ||
The willingness to learn and adapt. To lead by example.
Alison, Associate Success Team Lead ||
Active listening and effective communication skills are key!"

You’ve just received a lead in your Kicksite account—now what?
The time between a prospect’s lead capture form submission and your initial response is critical — in fact, it should happen
within the first 5 minutes
because you are
400x more likely to get a response
! But what should you say? And how can you ensure you’re notified immediately?
First things first: to respond quickly, be sure to set up
Quick Connect
in your Kicksite account to receive instant notifications when people submit their information on your lead capture forms or website. If a lead has opted into SMS communication, you can engage with them even faster via a quick text. Not everyone may opt into SMS communication, and that’s okay! Aside from texting, you can also utilize prospects’ provided phone numbers and email addresses to engage potential prospects in other ways.
According to HubSpot, email open rates typically range from 19% to 26% at best. In contrast, research says that
90% of text messages are read within three minutes
. However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take advantage of reaching out by calls or emails — just be mindful not to overwhelm potential clients by using all three at once!
After first reaching out to new prospects, it’s essential to track their status, make notes, and assign any further follow ups. In the Kicksite
Prospects list
, you can do just that. In this section of the software, you can update lead status, set appointments and tasks, add notes for each prospect, and even assign them to specific employees to manage.
Refining your follow-up process
You’ve just messaged a potential prospect funneled into your Kicksite account—great! But what if they don’t reply right away? That’s completely normal, and it doesn’t mean you should stop there. Once a lead is generated, it’s your job to nurture them until they become a member, which can take up to
seven interactions
to convert.
We repeat: if a prospect doesn’t respond or sign up after you’ve reached out just 1 or 2 times,
they are not a dead lead!
Having a
structured message flow
, along with both
manual and automated response templates
, helps streamline communication and improve response times. Keep in mind not to overwhelm your leads with excessive communication, as not all leads require the same level of follow-up. Tailor your outreach based on their interests, engagement level, and activity.
Generally, sending two to three reminders per week helps maintain interest without being intrusive. Utilize your Kicksite martial arts software to track lead status and refine your communication strategy, ensuring each prospect receives a personalized and effective follow-up journey.
Personalizing your follow-up messages to align with both your business and potential students is essential for building strong connections. Consider including student success stories, class recaps, self-defense tips and techniques, or updates relevant to your community. Use compelling headlines to grab attention and keep your audience engaged. Explore these

How to follow up with leads on social media
While website leads are essential, don’t forget to leverage all your business platforms to maximize awareness and visibility! Staying active on social media—such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok—offers a powerful way to connect with potential clients. Since prospects may reach out through these channels, having an automated messaging system in place is crucial for timely engagement and lead nurturing. Fortunately, these social media platforms have built-in automated welcome message capabilities that you can take advantage of.
Check out these great resources for setting up effective communication on each platform:
Meta
(Facebook and Instagram)
TikTok
Let’s recap
The lead nurturing process takes time and effort — it’s not a one-and-done task. Instead, it’s a personalized journey that requires organization and consistent follow-ups. Receiving a lead submission is just the first step in an ongoing process.
Finding the right balance between too little and too much communication can be challenging, but setting up an automated response system with personalized touches can help you refine your outreach strategy based on each prospect’s interests.
Be sure to organize your leads in a CRM system to track their engagement and communication levels. And remember—just because you don’t receive an immediate response doesn’t mean you should stop following up!"

With the new year comes New Year’s resolutions. Countless people decide that this is the year they will better themselves, often focusing on physical fitness. In fact, it’s estimated that
79%
of New Year’s goals involve improving health!
This translates to a perfect growth opportunity for your martial arts school. While many swarm to a typical, run-of-the-mill gym, some may look for an alternate source of fitness. With some good marketing, you can catch attention and make martial arts the activity of choice for people as they pursue newfound goals to better their physical health. But while that initial sign-up is important, it’s just as crucial to make sure they keep coming back and don’t fall victim to a dreaded resolution-fail. Here are some tips for making a great first impression to snag those New Year’s Resolution students and making sure they stick around!
Marketing to New Year’s Resolution Students
Marketing is crucial during the New Year so you can break through the noise of competitors and other fitness-based businesses trying to get the attention of resolutioners. Potential students will likely be searching online to see what businesses offer them a chance to make 2025 their year to get fit. And this isn’t just an assumption – in early 2024, Google searches for ‘gym membership’ reached their highest search volume in the last 5 years! We’ve offered some basic tips below, but if you need some assistance in the world of marketing, Kicksite now offers
Marketing Services
where our team of experts can get Google and social media ads up and running for you!
Offer New Year Deals
New Year deals can be great for business! Whether it’s a free trial, short-term memberships, limited time discounts for new customers, or anything else, they can grab the attention of those interested. It’s an easy way to entice those looking to improve themselves and convince them that martial arts is worth trying to improve fitness and gain self-confidence. We highly recommend creating limited-time “New Year’s Only” deals and make corresponding
Landing Page
for the deals within Kicksite. If you have integrated billing, you can even collect card information right at signup to make these new students stickier and more likely to commit.
Highlight your Beginner Classes
Joining a martial arts school could be intimidating, even with the 2025 resolution motivation boost. Inexperienced or brand new martial artists may feel unsure about choosing it as their path to fitness. Make sure that any promotions you run emphasize that you can start from any level and grow at your own pace in martial arts. Stress that there is no judgment, and that all are welcome on your mats. Considering sharing testimonials or stories from current students who started with little or no martial arts experience and have grown on their journey. The more confidence you instill in those who are considering your school, the more likely they are to pull the trigger on signing up!
Emphasize the Health Benefits
One of the biggest motivators with New Year’s resolutions is people wanting to cut weight and improve their physical appearance. Martial arts is a great way to achieve this goal, but may not be the first thing people think of for weight loss. This is another instance where you might have current students who can speak to or highlight the physical transformation they’ve experienced through martial arts. At the same time, you can also promote the
mental health benefits
that martial arts and Jiu-Jitsu provide. If they know that your training can uplift them both
physically and mentally
, you may see a flock of new customers entering your doors.
Retaining New Year’s Resolution Students
So you see a boost in new students for the New Year. Woohoo! While this is a positive, it’s also human nature for a brief surge in motivation to fade away once some difficult work is put in and life comes your way. It’s believed that nearly
80% of people
fail their New Year’s resolutions! It is crucial that these students quickly find a passion and sense of joy at your school so they continue their journey (and continue to give you their business).
Build a Strong Rapport Early
When a new New Year’s Resolution student walks in the doors it’s important to make a strong first impression. You want to keep this student coming back and make sure they feel welcome. A simple way to do this is with a smile, a nice conversation, and a teacher-student connection . A good relationship makes student retention that much easier. In our recent Academy Excellence webinar, we recommended that a new student’s first visit should be accompanied by a thorough tour of the facility so they feel comfortable and understand how to navigate the space. Consider having them check in on your attendance tablet so they see their name pop up upon entering. These small personal touches shows that you genuinely care and that your school is above and beyond a standard chain gym they could have signed up for instead.
Help Their Individual Needs and Goals
If a new student joins your school and feels like a face lost in the crowd, they may quickly lose interest. To ensure they are comfortable, work with them one-on-one, ask questions, and learn what they are working toward. An additional recommendation in our Academy Excellence webinar was to conduct an individual assessment during that first visit. During the assessment, you’ll pinpoint their personal goals, discover any issues to be aware of (injuries or discomfort that might inhibit training), and other key factors that will help them be set up for success on Day 1. Once they feel heard and appreciated, they are far more likely to make martial arts more than a phase.
Keep Them Motivated and Show Potential of Long-Term Training
People are impatient! After just one class, or maybe a few, some may not feel convinced or sure that they’re seeing early results and hesitate to continue. Or, as we know is often the case, they just simply lose their New Year motivation. If you can, try to encourage them to stick with their goals and remember why they were intrigued by and interested in martial arts in the first place. Secondly, show them what an extended period of training can give them. Make sure they aren’t looking at themselves in 2026 regretting that they left your school. Kicksite has tools that can help you with this – setting up attendance awards, issuing Achievements for milestones or standout performance during class, or even constructing email and text messages sent exclusively to new students to encourage and support them."

Late March/early April opens up a whole week for students from preschool to college to have a week off school. This time away could be a great opportunity for you to get creative and offer Spring Break programs and camps for students to sign up for. While some families take vacations during this time, many parents are still working and scrambling to find something to occupy their kids’ time during the day.
Here’s a chance for you and your martial arts school to be a hero. Provide a resource for these parents while retaining current students and potentially even gaining new ones. It’s not too late to get something put together for Spring Break, so here are some quick tips to help you make it a success!
Structuring the Week
First things first: structure your Spring Break week. You’ll need to decide how you’ll run classes during the week. Will it be an all-day program with a variety of activites, similar to a shortened summer camp? Or, will it be one-hour, two-hour classes to fill portions of the kids’ day?
If you are simply running standard classes, then most of the day is business as usual. But you may want to consider supplementing your usual after-school class times with additional sessions during the day. This gives parents options to choose from. Maybe they’re able to leave work in the mid-day to be home, but could use an activity in the mornings for their kids. Consider reaching out to current parents and picking their brains about what Spring Break class times would be most beneficial.
If you decide to execute a more robust day-long camp, you’ll need to prepare for managing and executing the whole day. From drop-off to pick-up, an agenda must be planned out and balanced to make sure it is productive, entertaining, and takes student needs into consideration.
Agenda Tips
Start the day with a simple physical activity
(basic fitness routine like ladder drills, push-ups, sit-ups, etc.)
Use the 50/10 rule – 50 minutes of an activity followed by a 10 minute break
Along with martial arts activities, incorporate other fun games and free play time
Have an established time for lunch
break
While it might feel intimidating to plan these activities, it’s a good opportunity to mix things up and keep kids engaged with games and unique ways to spend their time. Whether that’s an outdoors activity (a water balloon or water gun fight is an easy one if it’s warm!), St. Patrick’s Day-themed events, etc., switching it up could be good for students who are in their own adjustment period to a week off.
Promotion
It’s one thing to build out and plan your special Spring Break program, but you want to be sure your students and parents actually know about it! First and foremost, make sure to tell kids and parents during and after classes leading up to Spring Break. But your promotion doesn’t and shouldn’t stop there. Here are some additional ways to drum up interest in Spring Break at your martial arts school.
Build Dedicated Landing Pages
You can use your Kicksite software to create Spring Break themed landing pages. Use these to collect Spring Break registrations and even take payments for additional Spring Break fees. For additional assistance, check out the guide in our Knowledge Base on
how to create a landing page
.
Create a Flyer/Graphic
Making flyers and graphics that can be printed and used online is crucial for promoting Spring Break at your school. Be sure to include a QR code on your flyers – this allows parents to go to your landing page straight from their to get signed up. And luckily, you can create downloadable QR codes for your Kicksite landing pages right in your Kicksite software! Check out an example for how to make QR codes for flyers and graphics
HERE
.
Consider hanging your flyers up at nearby coffee shops, grocery stores, community centers, and other local businesses where parents are likely to be spending their time. You may even be able to work with local school districts to promote your camp!
Social Media
and Online Listings
Social media is one of the most important places to promote your business all year long, and this goes for Spring Break as well. Publish the graphics you’ve created, provide details in the caption along with a link to your landing page, and encourage sharing.
Along with your standard platforms like Facebook and Instagram, consider less conventional sites like Reddit for promoting online. Most cities have a dedicated Subreddit where people share event info or ask questions. Your city may also have various websites dedicated to parents with a calendar of event listings. Reach out and see if you can get added!
Pricing
When setting up your pricing, don’t overcomplicate it. You may think you should set up a low price point to try and attract more customers, but that could undersell you and the value your business brings to kids. Set a fair price for customers that reflects the program you’re offering.
Other Pricing Tips
Research other local Spring Break camp prices
to establish a baseline
Don’t just research martial arts schools, but check out all kinds of sports programs. This will give you a better indicator of how parents perceive the value of these types of offerings
Offer discounts to those attending more than one day
Offer sibling discounts to parents sending multiple kids
Talk to your Clients
Don’t just listen to us – talk to your clients! Gathering ideas from both your younger students and their parents could assist in forming a thorough plan. They could help you determine the best possible timing by identifying overlapping Spring Break periods. Or, the parents have already discussed fun activities for their kids to enjoy that might help fill in gaps on your agenda. Either way, their feedback is very important to take into account to make this break a can’t-miss time at your school.
Other Considerations
Encourage parents to send them with a sack lunch
Be sure to take note of students’ allergies
and ensure they bring necessary items like EpiPens
Discuss any specific needs certain students may need with parents
Keep the dress code simple – comfortable athletic gear!

The incredibly popular social media platform, TikTok, is soon to have its privileges in the United States decided upon by the U.S. Supreme Court. The platform faces a nationwide ban after TikTok owner ByteDance was ordered to sell TikTok to a U.S. company by Jan. 19, 2025.
The Supreme Court will begin hearing oral arguments on Jan. 17, 2025 as The U.S. Department of Justice claims TikTok has access to American data and is sharing it with the Chinese government to manipulate American opinion through the app’s content. TikTok claims the government has no proof that security risk has occurred and says the ban would violate First Amendment rights for themselves and millions of Americans. We all await the Supreme Court’s decision or a possible sale, but should prepare for the TikTok ban regardless.
What Happens if TikTok is Banned?
If TikTok is banned by the Supreme Court and there is not a sale in the next coming days as this is being written, the app will be removed from American app stores and U.S. internet service providers will be told to block access to the site.
Nevertheless, the app will not disappear from your device if downloaded, but the services may be limited or unavailable with no updates expected and uncertainty on its usability. With that in mind, now is the time to act, prepare for the TikTok ban, and secure everything you need before January 19.
How this Affects Martial Arts Schools
You may or may not have a TikTok account for either your martial arts school or a personal account for sharing martial arts tips and knowledge. If you do, a TikTok ban would take away a great marketing resource where quick eye-catching videos can spread quickly, helping to grow your business or personal brand. In your case, martial arts education is an offering where short videos of moves, kicks, punches, etc. can attract the younger audience and interest them with the idea of joining your program.
Without TikTok, you could lose your connection to possible clients who keep up with your business or your day-to-day life. And if you’ve been using it consistently for a while now, you’ve probably uploaded a lot of content that you’re worried about losing. Fortunately, we’ve got you covered. In preparation, you need to take the necessary steps as soon as possible to secure all the content you’ve put on the platform so you you can potentially repurpose it elsewhere and keep your base engaged and interested.

TikTok’s fate has yet to be fully decided, but it’s important to be prepared in case it does go dark in the United States. There’s a chance either the Supreme Court, a buyer, or an executive order could keep TikTok alive. Regardless, we highly recommend you take the steps above to prepare for the TikTok ban on January 19 in order to best serve your business and avoid losing the martial arts content that you’ve worked hard to share!"

Late November is one of the most eventful times for businesses with Black Friday. As the holiday season kicks into high gear, the weekend of endless deals ensues. This year, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will take place on November 29, 2024 and December 2, 2024, respectively. Customers are scanning websites and local businesses for every bargain available. As a small business, it is imperative you embrace this key selling period and use every tool possible to take advantage of the nationwide shopping spree.
2023 STATS
Consumers spent $9.8 billion in online sales on Black Friday
90.6 million shopped online over 76.2 million in-store
Online shopping grows every year on Black Friday
The average discount was at 28%
Despite less traffic, Cyber Monday brought in $12.4 billion over Black Friday’s $9.8 billion
U.S. Black Friday sales were up +2.5% from 2022

HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND
1.
Offer Exclusive Deals and Coupons
The name of the game for Black Friday weekend is deals. Now’s the time to start planning your involvement and determine what discounts and offers you’ll provide to new and current customers to get them on board. More unique and enticing deals will be important for martial arts school rather than the standard specials you run throughout the year. Instead of offering a simple free trial or other standard introductory offers, offering “one-time-only” or other unique specials can make Black Friday a monstrous business success for your martial arts school.
2.
Paid Ads
The weekend of holiday offers is swarmed with deal after deal, making some fall through the cracks or lose visibility. By running paid search or social media ads, you can rise to the top of screens and social feeds for consumers who are interested in martial arts. While companies spar for attention and try to break through the noise, paid digital ads can give you an advantage and help get your buyers’ interest piqued. If you don’t know where to start with digital advertising, Kicksite offers
Marketing Services
where our team of experts will get them up and running in time for the holidays and manage them to ensure effectiveness.
3.
Offer Bundle Deals
Bundle deals are a great way to further entice customers to join you on the mat. Rather than making multiple smaller purchases on Black Friday for one person, one big purchase that includes friends or family members can set your offer apart from others. For inspiration, check out the story about our client, Kyle Watson at Watson Martial Arts,
HERE
to see how he used bundle deals and landing pages to bring in $45,000 last Black Friday alone with ‘unlimited’ two-year and lifetime memberships!
4.
Set Countdown Timers
Countdown timers are a staple of flash sales. It’s a good way to alert customers that they have a short time to take advantage of your deals. If you have a limited amount of rash guards on a deal or cap the number of special memberships you sell, customers may want to quickly take advantage rather than waiting. If your website does not have a true countdown timer, setting offer end dates and communicating limited quantities also furthers the sense of urgency.
5. Create a Landing Page
A separate landing page for Black Friday/Cyber Monday makes the customer experience vastly different. Instead of hunting for deals, all it takes is one click and they have a dedicated page to view all the available offers. Quick and simple website interactions make sales much easier and provide a better user experience. Everything from offers on merchandise to membership signups can all be on one page together for customers to peruse. Check out Kicksite’s latest landing page live training session

.
6.
Offer Purchasing Thresholds
Purchasing thresholds are a great way to entice customers to go the extra mile. Customers may jump on board for a larger purchase with the discount (Ex: 10% off with a purchase of $20 or more, 20% off with $50 or more, 30% off for purchase of $100 or more), possibly signing up their whole family for a martial arts class instead of just themselves.
Kicksite Tools that can Help
1.
Creating a Landing Page
One of Kicksite’s key tools for this upcoming holiday season is our Landing Pages tool. You’re able to create a customized, one-off landing page just for holiday specials. With the capability to embed membership signup flows, sell items, and even run credit card transactions, landing pages become a hub where students or parents can easily take advantage of your offer without any confusion.

Published June 29, 2023. Updated on April 8, 2025 to reflect Kicksite’s uplifted Finances experience.
Kicksite’s uplifted Finances experience introduced a handful of new features designed to make managing your school’s money WAY easier. At the core of all of these improvements, one key element will save you major headaches during tax season:
invoices.
Invoices help you record every possible payment within your academy, and Kicksite makes creating invoices quick and easy so you can monitor your business’s finances. Say goodbye to scrambling through tons of files or spending hours finding a paper trail. It’s a simple step to get organized, take control of your cash flow, and make your business better!
THE BASICS: WHAT’S AN INVOICE?
First, it’s important to understand: What’s an invoice? An invoice is simply a timestamped document that records a
possible
payment between a seller and a customer, much like a bill
.
Whether someone is buys a t-shirt, gi, or anything else, it should be recorded as an invoice. It’s critical for internal and external audits but can be managed solely by your trusted staff and administration.
On an invoice, you’ll often find terms & conditions and additional information regarding the payment. By making note of pricing, products, and additional fees, you’ll be able to visualize and note details that may have been unclear before. Things such as total units purchased, revenue stream, and tax charges will be outlined for your assessment and safekeeping.
While some businesses still record invoices on paper,  digital invoices are pretty common these days and remove the many hassles and inconveniences of manual paperwork. Kicksite’s uplifted Finances system allows you to instantly send invoices to customers via email or print them as needed. Not only that, but you’ll have an immediate organized view of your invoices that gives you quick access to those that have not been paid.
Quick, seamless, and simple!
WHY ARE INVOICES IMPORTANT?
TAXES
Kicksite invoicing allows you to track the taxes you are legally obligated to pay. A Collected Tax report allows business owners (like you!) to effortlessly track the amount of taxes that you have gathered from customers. Utilizing invoices can help you avoid legal predicaments with the IRS, but also maximize your cash flow in the process. By utilizing our invoicing features and having all this information at your fingertips, you’ll put yourself in a better position when it comes time to file your business taxes.
Save yourself the headache down the road and start utilizing invoices
today
if you haven’t already!
CASH FLOW
Tax preparedness is not the only way invoices put your business on solid financial footing. Invoicing allows you to control and visualize both the money you gain and potentially spend. As an individual, you watch your bank account balance and avoid overdraft fees, so why not track your company’s finances with equal amounts of care to maintain a healthy situation for your business?
By using Kicksite you can closely monitor unpaid bills and forgotten charges. Managing Past Due invoices is a breeze in our system, so you can send payment reminders and follow-ups quickly. With just a few taps, you can also view and resolve open balances with payment processing built right into the system. What you AND your customers will enjoy the most about these features is being able to settle dues
quickly
and
without any hassle. You’ll be able to confidently detect delinquent accounts and act accordingly to ensure business growth.
That means no more tracking down customers!
MANAGEMENT
Overall, invoicing will benefit your business by establishing sound accounting practices and improving your efficiency. It’s a valuable feature that allows you to see vital financial information and more easily take administrative actions. You’ll be able to spot pain points and assess where your time, attention, and investment need to be directed for important financial decisions.

A Black American athlete, martial artist and actor. - Kicksite",,2025-10-27 13:52:27.617121+00:00,"Who is Jim Kelly? A Black American athlete, martial artist and actor.
Jim Kelly was a Black American martial artist and actor, most known for starring alongside Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon as well as his Karate championships. He passed on June 29th, 2013 with a
reputation that preceded him
. Kelly’s legacy is filled with passionate fights, memorable quotes, and incredible stage presence.
When Jim Kelly first began his rise to stardom, martial arts was dominated by Asian settings and culture. Kelly stood as a Black figure who was a Karate champion when most notable Black fighters were boxers. His acting roles would nod towards his model-esque look and feature his iconic afro. Some notable films that featured him include: “Enter the Dragon”, “Black Belt Jones”, “Three the Hard Way”,  “Black Samurai”, and more!
Athlete
What resulted in Hollywood success wasn’t easy sailing. Jim Kelly began his athletic career in his hometown of Paris, Kentucky where he competed in basketball, football, and track and field at Bourbon County High School. His success led him to attend the University of Louisville on a football scholarship. Unfortunately, Kelly witnessed a coach use a racial slur against his teammate and chose to cut his time short during his freshman year. .
Martial Artist
When one door closes, another opens. After his time with football ended, Jim Kelly began training martial arts with Okinawan Karate under Sin Kwang The’ in Lexington, Kentucky. In the 1970s, Kelly soared to the top of the ranks and became one of Karate’s most decorated world champions. He won four prestigious championships in 1971 and opened his dojo shortly after in the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. His dojo became a spot for many Hollywood celebrities, leading him to his path as an actor.
Actor
Jim Kelly was the first Black martial arts film star. His Hollywood career began with a martial arts instructor role in “Melinda” (1972). His appearance developed after the film’s writer asked him to join the cast when he taught star Calvin Lockhart martial arts. His career blossomed from there. Kelly co-starred with Bruce Lee in “Enter the Dragon” where he played Lee’s counterpart. This role came to him when the intended actor dropped out unexpectedly and producer Fred Weintraub heard of Kelly’s famous karate studio. When Weintraub visited, he was immediately impressed by Kelly and the rest became history.
As we celebrate Jim Kelly’s life, success, and accomplishments, we look back fondly at the legacy he created. He paved the way for many Black martial artists by making a memorable and powerful presence on screen. Regardless of the prejudice he faced during his journey, he overcame and worked towards success. As we conclude Black History Month it’s important to celebrate the accomplishments of Black people like Jim Kelly and their significant and diverse contributions. Whether it’s martial arts films, scientific discoveries, pop culture, or everything in between, we must recognize the great changes that have happened thanks to Black people of all ages and genders."

Kelly Beringson owns Tharros Jiu-Jitsu Academy in Delray Beach, Florida. Kelly has been a repeated champion since she was a white belt competing locally. Now she has won Pan American champion two years in a row!
When did you first start training in martial arts? How did you get started?
I first began training in 2016. I had a severe leg injury that led to me not being able to walk and being morbidly obese. I saw Rhonda Rousey on TV and decided I would find a way to walk and become an MMA fighter. After a few more surgeries and a lot of determination I wa sable to lose 150lbs and started MMA. After 3 fights I realized that striking was not for me, but I had fallen in love with jiu-jitsu!
When did you open your school? How did you know you wanted to do this?
I opened my Academy a little over a year ago. I was luckily enough to learn how to be an instructor since I was a white belt. I absolutely love giving away the knowledge that is given to me. My Professor told me when he gave me my black belt that I am meant to own an academy.  He has never misguided me so I trusted him. It was all just meant to be. There is truly nothing I enjoy more.
What is your proudest achievement so far?
Honestly my proudest achievement in jiu-jitsu is my academy.  Solely based on what it is doing for the community.  We are really building something different and it is extremely special. Watching how it is benefitting everyone and knowing how many more it will touch is what drives my soul to keep growing.
What are you shooting for next? Any big goals on or off the mat?
I am finally having a knee replacement next month and so I do have plans to return to competition. However , my biggest goal is to create a larger community of instructors to continue passing on what is so special about Tharros Academy.
Who is your biggest inspiration in pursuing martial arts or business ownership?
Business ownership I learned from my mother from a young age. I have been self employed since I was 22 years old. I am honestly a really bad employee but a phenomenal business owner.  As for martial arts originally is was Rhonda Rousey when I was focused on MMA. When my focus switched to jiu-jitsu so did my inspirations. I have many including all of my mentors.
Give us a fun fact about yourself outside of training!
I am currently writing a book and can’t wait to put it into publication.

At Kicksite, we enthusiastically support the mission of bringing the joys and benefits of martial arts to as many people as humanly possible. We also understand that in order for our customers to do that, they need to be bringing in leads and ultimately converting them to students.
Sometimes that feels a lot easier said than done. But with our latest big development project, we’ve made some major strides forward in providing an enhanced Prospect management experience so that nurturing leads is more organized, efficient, and flexible for you and your staff.
Today we are officially rolling out the uplifted Kicksite Prospects list to all users!
But trust us when we say this is far more than just a list. Below we’ve highlighted some of the key features and updates you’ll find as you manage your martial arts school’s Prospects in this new system.
TWO VIEW OPTIONS | TABLE AND BOARD
When we decided to pursue an uplift of our Prospects list, we immediately knew we wanted to create a default ‘Board’ view similar to what you commonly see in lead management or project management systems. Sometimes referred to as a Kanban board, this type of layout offers a more visual representation of a Prospect’s movement through your sales funnel through a series of columns and cards. More on these things later!
But we also wanted to provide flexibility. We know not every school manages their leads in the same way, and many Kicksite users have become accustomed to the Prospects List that has existed in our martial arts software for a while now. So, rather than completely ditch the List view, we instead decided to amp it up as well, and introduce some new elements that make it easier to organize and customize through the Table view.
CUSTOMIZABLE LEAD STAGES
With the new Kicksite Prospects list, there are four default lead stages:
Lead
Qualified
Appointment
Trial
However, this is another instance where we knew we needed to make these lead stages flexible and adaptable to each school’s unique methods and processes.
Lead
is the only default stage that can’t be deleted
or
moved.
Trial
can’t be deleted, but
can
be moved. Beyond that, you’ll have the freedom to make these stages work best for you!
You can rename, color-code, and reorder these stages, and even create brand-new stages if you have additional activities or processes you want to track. Stages are reflected in
both
the Table and Board views, as a dropdown selector for each Prospect on the Table and as columns that hold Prospect cards on the Board.
DRAG AND DROP FUNCTIONALITY
Speaking of those columns and cards on the Board view: we’re super excited to give Kicksite users the ability to simply drag and drop a Prospect from one Stage to the next! The ability to drag and drop cards is a fairly universal and critical component of lead and project management boards, so it only made sense to let you all have that capability too. Plus, it’s just a pretty satisfying feeling dragging a Prospect all the way through those columns and watching them turn into a conversion! You can also drag cards vertically within a column to reorder them if you want to adjust follow-up priority for you and your staff.
LEAD PRIORITY INDICATORS
On both the Table and Board view, you’ll notice that you now have the ability to establish a lead’s priority. The Lead Stage options are pretty straightforward and, again, pretty universal when it comes to lead management:
Hot
– Ready to commit and/or highly communicative
Warm
– Don’t show as much urgency, but may just be in the early stages of shopping around and need a bit of nurturing
Cold
– Low urgency, little to no communication, will require intensive follow-up and nurturing
While the above are general guidelines for each Priority level, for the sake of consistency you may want to establish specific internal criteria for what constitutes a Hot, Warm, and Cold Prospect at your school. All Prospects that enter your system will be set to Warm, but you can change their Priority status at any time on either view!
CARD DETAIL DISPLAY OPTIONS
Rounding out the Board view are cards for each Prospect. By default, these cards include the name of the Prospect, the most recent comment that has been added, and an icon representing that Prospect’s Priority level.
But
, one key piece of feedback we received from several beta testers was that many wanted an option to include even more detail.
We heard that feedback loud and clear and implemented the ability to also show the date and time of any appointments that have been scheduled with the Prospect, as well as how much time they have left in their Trial. These settings are customizable for each stage and easily toggled on and off!
UPLIFTED DASHBOARD REPORTING
We couldn’t just build out this really cool, visually-focused new prospecting board without also building out some really cool, visually-focused new Dashboard data. After all, your Kicksite Dashboard is the central hub of your martial arts software. Having a helpful, easily scannable representation of your leads and their status is pretty important!
Now when you click the Prospects tab on your Dashboard, you won’t just see a list of names. First, you’ll see a comprehensive summary of your Lead Stages, showing how many Prospects you currently have in each stage, coupled with a breakdown of their Priority status. You’ll also have a quick view of how many new leads you’ve had in the past 7 days, with the ability to click through and view them in more detail.
Below that, you’ll see a couple charts. One is focused solely on Stage Distribution, while the other outlines your overall Priority Distribution. They may be simple, but we love how the colors and visualizations offer up a quick and easy snapshot of your Prospect information.

This is a very high-level overview of what’s new in the Kicksite Prospects list. We definitely recommend you also check out our

When shopping around for member management software, doing your research and due diligence is important. But are you properly scrutinizing potential payment processors too? Member management and payment processing go hand-in-hand, so you should be equally particular about what company you select to handle your money. In a world where there’s an increasing number of payment processors both big and small, you’re likely to run into some questionable sales tactics. Some of the things you see and hear might seem shiny and appealing on the surface, but be wary of things that sound too good to be true. Below we’ve listed 4 payment processor red flags to look out for during your search.
Immediate approval
“Get approved instantly!” “Get up and running in less than 10 minutes!” These are the types of prompts you’ll frequently see from payment processors trying to hook you into doing business with them. At first glance, it seems like a no-brainer, right? You can start processing payments without waiting! So what’s the problem?
When a payment processor approves you immediately, it means they are avoiding an important step called underwriting. During underwriting, a payment processor gets to know your business, asking you questions to understand it better. This allows a processor to get a bigger picture view of your financial situation and future. While the underwriting process can take a little bit longer, it also means that the processor is putting full faith into you and your business. You’ll not only get your money faster, but you’ll also be far less likely to have money unexpectedly held and kept from you.
The opposite is true with payment processors who approve you instantly. No underwriting process means they don’t know you or your business. If they detect even the slightest sense of risk in a transaction, they will potentially hold your money for an undetermined length of time. And in some instances, they may even shut down your account. Do you really want to entrust your money with a company that doesn’t even bother to get to know you or understand your business goals?
Unbelievably low processing fees
Like the old adage says, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This rings especially true when comparison shopping on the internet, and payment processing is no different. You might stumble onto companies that advertise payment processing rates that are FAR below competitors and feel compelled to jump on to take advantage.
But we would encourage you to dig deeper to get the actual story behind these advertised rates. While we could write a separate (and lengthy) blog post about processing fees and what goes into them, here’s a basic primer.
At the root of processing fees are interchange fees, which are included on every debit and credit card transaction in order to compensate issuing banks, pay for consumer rewards, and ensure anti-fraud measures. While the fee percentage is variable based on the type of card, type of transaction, how the payment is processed, etc., interchange fees are non-negotiable. They MUST be accounted for with every card transaction.
If you see payment processing rates under 2% being promoted, be wary. What is most likely being pitched is a tiered pricing structure. Those extremely low rates only apply to a select few types of transactions and certain types of cards. And if you do the majority of your processing with stored credit cards or recurring billings, you may never qualify for that lowest tier rate.
Don’t fall for a bait and switch – if you see a company with processing fees that are disproportionately lower than everyone else, there’s probably more to it than meets the eye. Ask questions to see what you’ll REALLY be paying, and determine what’s truly best for your business.
No fees listed at all
Transparency is key when it comes to money. At Kicksite, we’ve always been proud to have the most transparent pricing in the industry. You won’t find any hidden charges here – from our monthly software and website services costs to our payment processing fees, we are open and honest about what you can expect.
Unfortunately, there’s an increasing number of companies that take the opposite approach. There’s a complete lack of transparency and pricing isn’t easily accessible. They might force you to fill out a form or call them to get information instead of just having their fees listed out plain, simple and easy to find. But why? If they’ve got nothing to hide, then why are they hiding it?
Whether it’s software, payment processing, or another product entirely, we will always be proponents of being upfront and straightforward about finances. As customers, we would want a company to be honest and forthcoming about what we can expect to spend, so why shouldn’t businesses extend that courtesy?
Very little business information available
If you’re trying to avoid the big behemoth payment processors and instead checking out smaller companies, we totally get it! We’re big proponents of supporting small, local businesses – it’s one of the main reasons we’re proud to partner with our hometown company
BASYS Processing
.
But unfortunately, small and local doesn’t always equal trustworthy and established. When exploring these smaller payment processing businesses, make sure to do your research into their history and reputation. Some good places to start include:
Better Business Bureau website
Google reviews
Review sites like
Card Payment Options
Local business journal/business news websites
Glassdoor
While this practice can take some time, it will give you valuable perspective and insight into who these companies are. And if you are barely able to find any information at all? Well, it’s probably a solid sign that you should avoid that company. It once again boils down to trust – if you can’t find any third party confirmation of a payment processor’s trustworthiness or longevity, do you really want them handling your money?
Properly vetting who you partner with can save you a lot of future headaches. And knowing these payment processing red flags should empower you to make an educated decision on which businesses can make YOUR business better.

Martial arts is practiced on an international level and, accordingly, is celebrated within many cultures around the globe. September 15th marked the start of Hispanic Heritage Month. Hispanic heritage runs deep within martial arts, with iconic Hispanic champions including Tito Ortiz, Dominick Cruz, Brandon Moreno, Cain Valasquez, Jessica Aguilar, and Mariano Mendoza.
Mariano Mendoza is more than a Mexican world champion weightlifter. He’s also a U.S. Navy veteran, writer, and actor. Mariano was born in Los Angeles, California, and continues to work there today. Before taking martial arts by storm, Mariano was in the U.S. Navy and Army Reserves from 1986-1995.
Mariano grew up in a troubled household, but turned to sports for support. His martial arts journey started off with karate where he naturally excelled, placing second at his first competition, The Long Beach International Karate Championships. Eventually, Mariano transitioned to Muay Thai, where he learned entirely new skills and techniques. During his training a promoter came up and helped Mariano start his professional fighting career. As they say, the rest is
history
.
Since he started professionally fighting, he’s celebrated several achievements on his journey, including being the first Hispanic Heavyweight Cage Fighter to fight in the W.V.C. in Brazil and Jamaica, his world record title Muscle Beach Strong Man 1995 and 1996, and even holding the World Record Strict Curl at 220lbs in 2015. His long line of success has earned him the title of “World’s Strong Latino” and was rated in the top 100 fighters in the world by Grappler Magazine.
Off the mat, Mariano is immersed in the world of film as a stuntman, actor, and producer. So if you recognize his face, it could be from “Better Call Saul”,  “Training Day”, “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”, or any of his other 160 TV and movie appearances. Mariano’s success in media and martial arts landed him to be featured in a handful of video games, including MMA Supremacy and Saints Row 3. His short video autobiography “The Untold Story of Mariano Mendoza” was released in 2017, and dives into his uprising as a Hispanic martial artist and actor. Today, Mariano continues to celebrate his achievements and expand his experience in both industries.
While Mariano “Big Dawg” Medoza is just one notable Hispanic athlete who is prominent in media and martial arts, we use Hispanic Heritage Month as a moment to celebrate everyone of Hispanic heritage and those who are paving the way for future generations."

There’s no doubt about it – exercising is great for your body and mind in various ways. But what makes martial arts any different than traditional sports and extracurricular activities? Let’s dive deeper and appreciate what martial arts offers us through training.
PHYSICAL BENEFITS
There’s a large variety of martial arts with each having their own respective
physical benefits
. Altogether, they share some core physical benefits that will help improve your health and lifestyle.
1. Self-defense
This important skill is exclusive to martial arts training. It’s not something you can gain from football, baseball, or any other traditional sport. You can’t undersell the importance of self-defense because not only can you protect yourself, but also your loved ones through grappling, kicks, and strikes.
2. Overall physical fitness
Martial arts utilizes your entire body to train. Being consistent has proven to show better mobility, flexibility, and coordination.  While you are burning calories you’re also sharpening your techniques.
3. Stamina and conditioning
Along with contributing to your overall fitness, regular martial arts training will benefit other areas of your life, particularly if you participate in sports. It will reduce muscle tension, risk of injury, and feeling behind when you come-back from the off-season.
4. Blood Pressure
We often forget to recognize the less visible physical benefits of training. Not only do martial artists have lower blood pressure and heart rates, but they have also improved overall heart health. Training lowers cholesterol and provides more regulated blood sugar and insulin levels.
MENTAL BENEFITS
It’s important to recognize that while mental health matters, not everyone has the capabilities or willingness to seek treatment. Fortunately, many people are able to help take care of their mental wellbeing through other activities such as sports. It provides a more affordable outlet to
improve mental health
all while doing something they enjoy. There are numerous ways it can help your state of mind, so let’s highlight the top contenders for mental benefits.
1. Emotional regulation
Life can be overwhelming with the worries of work, school, or home life, but martial arts helps you control these feelings. Training and learning to manage your emotions can ease anxiety, depression, or anger issues and help you overcome obstacles.
2. Improved Self-Esteem
Martial arts trains you to recover from setbacks and determine how to overcome them in the future. It sets a foundation for confidence and prepares you for future adversities. Some schools will even have “mat chats” to accompany their physical training.
3. Personal Development
In unity with the last two points, training encourages you to consider your approach to life and way of thinking. While you may have teammates and a community while training, martial arts is an individual sport that allows for internal self-evaluation. You’re able reflect on your thoughts, feelings, goals, and each step you need to take to achieve a better lifestyle.
4. Find a Community
It’s guaranteed you will meet new people in a martial arts class. Going regularly will even give you the chance to make friends and socialize with people that share interests with you. Making friends while training can boost your mental health and self-esteem."

It’s the holiday season and the perfect time to ask for gifts (or gift yourself!) so you can upgrade your aesthetics, better integrate with Kicksite’s tools, and improve your overall business functionality. Here’s a handful of recommendations our team put together along with examples of each so you can put your wish list together just in time for Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales! No affiliate links here – we just want your academy to be the best it can be.
Prices shown below reflect cost at time of publishing, they may have changed since.
2D Barcode Scanner
A simple 2D barcode scanner is a great low cost item to add on your school’s holiday wishlist. The scanner can help students check in to class more easily and make the arrival process more streamlined for everybody. Connecting a barcode scanner to your device and turning on barcode checkin within Kicksite is incredibly simple, and allows students to pull up a mobile barcode in the Kicksite Member Portal, scan it, and get checked in! We highly recommend getting one that is freestanding or includes a stand so it’s truly a hands free experience.
Examples:
Symcode Omnidirectional 2D Hands-Free USB Barcode Scanner ($44.09)
AMBIR DB100 Omni-directional Desktop USB 2D Barcode Reader ($99.95)
Tablet
A nice tablet can serve a very similar purpose as the 2D barcode scanner, providing another way for students to check into class. When you launch Kiosk Check In mode within Kicksite, your tablet serves as an easy, self-service attendance station where students simply enter their PIN number to check into class. Additionally, that tablet can serve other purposes for your business, including displaying landing pages and offers for walk-in signups. Refurbished devices are a great way to save a bit of money, but make sure to check out our Knowledge Base guide noting which devices operating systems are no longer supported by their manufacturers to ensure Kicksite compatibility.
Examples:
10.9″ Samsung Galaxy S9 FE (Starting at $329.99)
Apple iPad 10th Generation (Starting at $349)
Tablet
Accessories
If you’re investing in a tablet, we HIGHLY advise also picking up some accessories to keep it safe and keep it clean (especially if there are going to be a LOT of student hands using it to check in). At the top of the list would be a case and a screen protector. You’ll want to search for cases and protectors that are specific to the type of tablet you purchase, because screen sizes and shapes may vary. Many screen protectors are anti-fingerprint and anti-microbial, so look for those callouts as an added layer of protection.
Printer
A compact printer can be another versatile addition to make to your business better and streamline your drop-in and walk-in processes. After creating a landing page in Kicksite you can generate a QR code for it and in turn, drop that QR code onto a simple flyer. New or visiting students can scan that QR code using their phone, drop their information into the landing page, sign an agreement, pay any necessary fees, and they’re immediately funneled into your system without you having to lift a finger. Check out how to use Kicksite’s QR feature to make flyers

While you are buying gifts yourself, your students are shopping too and may be interested in picking up school apparel as a potential gift item (especially if you’re running holiday deals!). Clothing racks can take up a lot of valuable real estate, but it’s helpful to put things on display so people can see what you have to offer. There are some lower profile merchandise display options you can check out that don’t eat up floor space. Consider a collapsible clothing rack or a grid wall affixed with hooks/hangers to put your shirts, gis, etc. on display, and easily stash them away when not in use!
Examples:
BOQORAD Wall-Mounted Collapsible Clothing Rack ($42.99)
GRID 3-Panel Retail Unit ($89.95)
Disinfectant Sprayer
It’s always important to keep your school clean, but as the holiday season nears, so do increased germs, viruses and under-the-weather students. Make sure you’re prepared for everyone to be safe and healthy and avoid some of the more back-breaking cleaning work by investing in a sprayer for your school’s mats. There are a variety of options including more affordable sprayers that you carry around as you clean, or fancier wheeled sprayers that help save you a bit of physical labor. Wouldn’t it be nice to say goodbye to mopping?
Examples:
MATGUARD Industrial Sprayer ($60)
Kennedy Industries Spray N Roll II Sprayer ($212.47)
Stackable Storage System
Tired of flip-flops, shoes, keys and other items cluttering up your gym space? Having a dedicated place for students to put their belongings is a small but impactful way to improve your school. We’re partial to a modular, stackable system that allows you to customize exactly how the storage bins are laid out. And we definitely recommend choosing one that’s made of plastic so it’s much easier to clean and disinfect. Our recommendation below even has small doors for each storage cube so that dust stays out and items are a bit more secure!

Summer is poised to be another massively profitable season for businesses and organizations hosting camps for kids, including martial arts summer camps. As video games, social media and endless streaming options lure kids in, parents are eager to get kids away from screens and keep their minds and bodies active during the summer months.
And with that strong demand comes an equally strong opportunity for martial arts schools to maintain and grow their business by running their own summer day camps. According to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association,
over 5 million kids participate in sports camps each year.
Still on the fence? Read on and we’ll explain why organizing camps can help your school in 3 key areas: Cash Flow, Retention, and Prospecting.
CASH FLOW
Prior to Covid-19, the market size of the summer camp sector was increasing rapidly, growing from $2.91 billion in 2011 to $3.91 billion in 2019, according to IBISWorld. You read that right –
ONE BILLION dollars of growth in less than a decade.
While summer camps took an inevitable hit in 2020, they bounced back slightly in 2021. And in 2022,

noted that summer camp demand heavily outweighed supply due to numerous camps closing permanently during Covid-19. Existing camps are often out of space, with people waitlisted in hopes of getting in.
With this high demand also comes a willingness to spend money to keep kids active during the summer. According to the
American Camp Association
,
the average cost of summer camp in the United States is around $87 per day.
So let’s put this simply: parents with money to spend, scrambling to find summer activities for their kids and get them out of the house, are desperate for options. There’s no better opportunity to maintain your business’ cash flow through the summer months than to meet this very real and pressing need for day camps.
RETENTION
Summer can be a scary time for a martial arts business owner – between family vacations, sports and other activities, there’s an increased risk of attrition with students who are being pulled in many directions and away from your school. But instead of potentially losing them to other programs, why not step up and position yourself AS the place for them to spend their summer days?
Consider proactive outreach to your students and their parents – whether you’re directly prompting them to sign up for a camp program you’ve already created, or even sending them a survey to find out what they’d most like to see from a martial arts summer camp.
And of course, Kicksite’s communication and
marketing tools
can help you accomplish this. Once your camp program details are nailed down, create an
Event
or
a lead capture form
and
landing page
or for signups, then blast it out to your students via email and text, all within your Kicksite software.
This personal effort will resonate with parents and can ultimately reduce student dropoff by giving them the opportunity to continue training through the summer and into the next school year.
PROSPECTING
Current student retention is an obvious benefit of running a martial arts summer camp program, but we’d be remiss not to mention the huge opportunity to bring new students into your school as well.
As noted, many of the summer camps that parents relied on in the past are at capacity due to fewer options available. Who’s to say that a kid originally interested in soccer camp couldn’t have an equally good time trying their hand (and feet) at Taekwondo? And let’s be realistic: the benefits of balance, strength, focus and discipline developed through martial arts can translate to a variety of other sports or physical activities that a student participates in.
Kicksite makes prospecting super easy. Once your summer camp sign-up landing page has been created, you can share it far beyond your current customer base. Drop the link into social media posts,
create a QR code
to go on signage, submit to national online camp directories, or share with media outlets in your city that provide summer camp listings to local parents.

For over 3,000 years, the world has practiced various forms of martial arts for self-defense, competition, and fitness. Many people already know that martial arts training improves your strength, mobility, and stamina. But in honor of Mental Health Awareness Month, let’s take a moment to recognize the additional benefits happening within. Improvements in emotional regulation, self-esteem, discipline, and personal development can make a world of difference to someone’s lifestyle. Many successful martial artists and academy owners attribute their mindset to what they’ve learned through Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Taekwondo, Krav Maga, Karate, and other martial arts. Some would even say that martial arts training saved their life. But how does
martial arts improve mental health
and character development?
1. STRESS RELIEF AND EMOTIONAL REGULATION
Balance is key to a healthy lifestyle. While you train, you aren’t just practicing kicks, throws, and punches. You are learning to practice deep breathing and meditation as well. This trains your mind to remain calm yet alert. While you learn to rechannel your focus, your mind opens up to better stress relief and emotional regulation. Martial arts training and exercise create healthy outlets to release negative emotions, including aggression or worry.
2. CONFIDENCE AND SELF-ESTEEM
Physical exercise releases chemicals like endorphins that “boost your mood.” After continuous training, it’ll also lead to more confidence and self-esteem. Directing your energy towards a positive lifestyle change that will build over time is a great way to improve your overall mindset. Your mind strengthens, and you learn to persevere through adversities on and off the mat. With newfound confidence, students learn to compete, lead their peers, and take action in their lives.
3. DISCIPLINE AND RESPONSIBILITY
Like any academy, teachers will hold you accountable for your improvement and actions. This is no different in martial arts. Students are expected to attend class and give their best effort on the mats. Work ethic is key to martial arts success; students can’t achieve their full potential when they lack the drive to achieve. Martial arts instructors and classmates push each other to become the best version of themselves. This isn’t possible without resilience and the discipline to continue putting forth effort.
4. OVERALL PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT
Whether practicing BJJ, Judo, Taekwondo, Krav Maga, Karate, or anything in between, you’ll be surrounded by goal-oriented, passionate individuals. A martial arts school is a positive, collaborative space where passion and mindfulness are contagious. Whether you intend to exercise more or learn self-defense, you walk away with much more. With every move you make, you practice situational awareness and creativity that benefits your life off the mat."

Nutrition is important for all training athletes, including martial artists. The diet you choose can help facilitate your goals, whether you’re working toward weight loss, muscle growth, improved stability, increased nutrients, etc. As active athletes, your diet can uplift the hard work done on the mat and make you that much more successful in finding your preferred physique or level of performance. Take a look at some resources and plans for National Nutrition Month in March and what could be best for you and your students!
Types of Diets
When setting yourself up with a nutrition plan, the first and most discussed aspect is your diet of choice. While some decide to just eat healthy without any particular parameters (which works well for many), others focus on a specific route and follow strict guidelines. Which one is the absolute best for you? No one outside yourself or a doctor/specialist can tell you that. Still, it’s important to check out the research and see what works for you as an athlete and a person. Here is a quick list of common and recommended nutrition plans for martial artists and athletes.
Mediterranean Diet
Consists of: Fruits, Vegetables, Whole grains, Healthy fats, Limited meat consumption
Pros: Weight-loss potential, Disease prevention, Brain health, Environment-friendly

Supplements and Vitamins
Once you pick out a diet and exercise regimen, there are still additional steps you can take to ensure a nutritious lifestyle. The proper resources and supplements can help with not just your diet, but muscle gain, sleep, energy levels, recovery, etc. Word of caution: most supplements are helpful when taken in moderation. If you’re not sure what amount is best for you and your goals, consult with your physician, trainer, or certified nutritionist!
Protein Powder
How it helps you:
Protein powder serves to help with muscle growth and repair. It’s great to use when actively weight lifting or exercising alongside a healthy diet. Protein supplements are primarily for convenience to supplement gaps in whole food nutrition. Not all protein powder is created equally – there are generally two categories of proteins and lots of different ways they are manufactured. Protein concentrates tend to be ideal for meal replacements. They have a slightly higher fat content that will add calories and digest more slowly. Protein Isolates, by contrast, are designed to isolate out the fats and lactose which make them rapidly absorbable, which is ideal for post-workout recovery or folks with lactose sensitivities.
To find a protein powder that tastes great (not chalky) and is easy on the stomach you should look for a product that clearly lists as much of its processing as possible on the packaging. Low temperature processing creates less protein denaturing and yields a tastier, more bioavailable product!
Creatine
How it helps you:
Creatine serves as another muscle growth and strength supplement. It is different from protein powder in that it adds a brief energy boost and is often taken before a weight lifting session. Creatine is there to help pull water into the muscle cell, creating volumization. Creatine also delays muscle fatigue by recycling your body’s ATP (adenosine triphosphate, it provides your cells energy!). It’s important to properly hydrate while using creatine. Generally, creatine is one of the most studied sport supplements out there and is incredibly safe. While there are lots of types of creatine, most of this seems to come down to clever marketing. Micronized creatine monohydrate is the simplest, most effective form of the supplement.
Caffeine
How it helps you:
Caffeine is another energy-related resource. It helps delay fatigue as well as keep you more mentally alert. It is especially helpful to endurance athletes to push through a long training session. Keep in mind that while the effects of caffeine may be noticeable as soon as 10 minutes after enjoying that energy drink, peak caffeine concentration doesn’t occur until about 45 minutes later. Also, be cautious of how late in the day you’re consuming caffeine. Caffeine levels in your body reduce by half roughly every six hours, so that afternoon pick-me-up could still be lingering when you’re trying to get to sleep!
Vitamin D
How it helps you:
Nearly 50% of the population has Vitamin D insufficiency
. Vitamin D is a great supplement for athletes that can be taken daily. It provides many benefits in supporting bone and muscle health as well as reducing inflammation. Your athletic performance and day-to-day functions outside of physical exercise can be greatly aided by Vitamin D.
Amino Acids
and Electrolytes
How it helps you:
Amino Acids are the building blocks of protein. Ideally you’ll get all the necessary amino acids you need through whole food, but this can be more challenging in a calorie deficit. There are a plethora of amino acid supplements for you to take as an athlete. Generally, you should seek out an Essential Amino Acid product with a 2:1:1 ratio. With there being different amino acids and combinations of amino acids, it’s important to do the research to find the right ones for you. Nevertheless, they are truly beneficial, helping with muscle growth, fatigue, endurance, among many other things. Bonus points if your amino acid supplement has electrolytes! Athletes sweat and lose vital micronutrients that help sustain athletic performance. For athletes, salt and electrolytes are vital for endurance.
Other Supplements to Look Into
Magnesium
B vitamins
Omega 3
Iron
Antioxidants
Potassium
Calcium"

/oh-yeen/
The Aztec “Ollin” symbol represents
movement
and transformation. It’s the motion and rhythm of the universe. It’s both destruction and creation. It’s fluid. It’s starting anew.
“The earth shakes for transformation… It shakes to create new life… We shake it off and we begin a brand new world.”
On September 19, 1985 an earthquake struck Mexico City, bringing hundreds of buildings to the ground and claiming thousands of lives. On the same date 32 years later, another earthquake shook the city yet again. This kind of tragic event can tear a community down, but it can also bring people closer together. That’s what it was like for Gloria Telles, Ollin Atlético’s head instructor.
When Gloria was preparing for a fight on September 19, 2017 and heard about the
Puebla Earthquake
affecting her hometown and family, she took it as a sign that everyone and everything needs constant
movement.
She continued to carry that energy and sentiment with her when she opened Ollin Atlético in 2024. Now she looks back on the community spirit she witnessed in the past and strives to create the same culture within her own academy.
Long before
Ollin Atlético
, there was Gloria, a 10 year old girl who was asking her mom if she could try martial arts at the local karate school. Then there was Gloria, a student meeting people from all walks of life who shared one goal – to work hard and receive a black belt. Finally there was Gloria, who was turning her dream into her reality.
“
We have to learn to give value by teaching.”
After four years of training, she received her black belt with the
Ernie Reyes West Coast Martial Arts Association
and started teaching. Along the way she even dove into amateur kickboxing and strength and conditioning to become a stronger fighter. After spending time on the stage as a competitor, something called back to her. In 2017, Gloria participated in her last big ticket fight, ready to return to her roots and dedicate herself to teaching.
Gloria and Program Director Jahida, now operate Ollin Atlético with the goal of cultivating an environment that echoes the unity witnessed in the aftermath of the Puebla Earthquake. This rings true in their classes and events where they’ve built confidence and trust. Within two years of opening, Gloria and Jahida have fostered their own close-knit community through martial arts in San Jose, California.
“When it comes to Hispanic culture, man, what a treat.”
Ollin Atlético’s mission is rooted in the same collaborative attitude as Aztecan times, where everyone relied on each other in an effort to grow together. There is no fear when everyone leans on one another. There is a community in Hispanic culture that is mirrored in San Jose. That becomes apparent through events such as
Viva CalleSJ
where the city comes together specifically to celebrate and honor Hispanic culture with music, food, and
movement.
Even beyond that, Jahida finds unique and diverse ways to bring people closer together – whether it’s through events like “Kick and Sip”, hosting MMA fighter Cris Cyborg, or offering Muay Thai clinics with Janet Garcia. There is an endless passion to share resources with students – the same resources Gloria had wished for when she first started training.
“People feel sincerity and people feel energy.”
The ability to  become so deeply integrated in your city and shared culture is special. Connecting with your community might be a daunting task for some, but luckily Gloria leaves fellow instructors with two pieces of advice:
Stay true.
Teach and unite with your community through being authentic. Be genuine in your values to create an honorable, comfortable environment.
Be compassionate.
Regardless of what you teach, martial arts or otherwise, they’re there for help. It can be for something as simple as
movement,
but if they’re smiling and sweating – we’ve done our job."

Every year, grapplers from around the world flock to Kissimmee, Florida for the largest BJJ tournament held in North America: the
Pan Jiu-Jitsu IBJJF Championship
. Whether you’re a first-time IBJJF Championship competitor or a seasoned veteran, it’s about that time where you’re probably starting to plot out what your week in Kissimmee will look like; aside from hitting the mats, of course. Well look no further – we’ve got you covered with a Pan IBJJF Championship travel guide to ensure that BJJ athletes and enthusiasts alike stay fed, fit and entertained.
EAT
RODEO DINER | KISSIMMEE
(about 2 miles from Silver Spurs Arena)
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and that old adage may ring especially true for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitors who need to fuel their bodies during the Pan IBJJF Championship. Sometimes the best breakfast is the simplest breakfast, and the
Rodeo Diner
takes a no-frills, classic approach to the morning meal. Grab yourself some steak and eggs or a loaded three egg omelet at this mom and pop joint before making the short trek to the tournament venue.
PAUL’S ITALIAN DELI AND RESTAURANT | KISSIMMEE
(about 2 miles from Silver Spurs arena)
Don’t let the unassuming exterior of
Paul’s Deli
fool you; this sandwich spot has been around for 3 decades and consistently receives rave reviews from locals and visitors alike. The Italian hero seems to be the fan favorite, with lots of love also being shown for the homemade meatballs. If NYC-style deli sandwiches are up your alley, consider Paul’s when you need a quick BJJ tournament food break; it’s conveniently just a short drive down the road from Silver Spurs Arena!

J CRAB HOUSE | KISSIMMEE
(about 8 miles from Silver Spurs arena)
For Jiu-Jitsu competitors visiting Florida from landlocked areas, hunting down some fresh seafood is probably at the top of the to-do list. Don’t sleep on blink-and-you’ll-miss-it J Crab House, found in the corner of a strip mall about 8 miles northwest of Silver Spurs Arena. Pick your seafood of choice (crab, lobster, mussels, clams and more), pick your sauce, and they’ll throw together a simple yet flavorful platter dusted with a special spice blend. Hours are limited and they recommend making a reservation, so go lock down your table
here
.
WHOLESOME KETO TREATS & EATS | ST. CLOUD
(about 5 miles from Silver Spurs arena)
Eating healthy can be tricky when you’re out of town and relying on restaurants for your meals.
Wholesome Keto Treats and Eats
is here to assist, with a menu full of sugar-free, low-carb, gluten-free and keto-friendly options to help athletes eat a bit better during the IBJJF Championship. Located about 5 miles from Silver Spurs Arena in St. Cloud, you can pick up healthier renditions of personal pizzas, chaffle breakfast sandwiches, cheeseburger lettuce wraps, or even a grilled chicken bowl. And if you have a nagging sweet tooth, you can round it all out with a keto-friendly brownie or rice krispy treat.
EXPLORE
KISSIMMEE LAKEFRONT PARK | KISSIMMEE
(about 3 miles from Silver Spurs arena)
Need a quick break from the chaos of rear-naked chokes, sweeps and armbars at Pans? Pop down to Kissimmee Lakefront Park to soak in the sights and sounds of local nature. Stroll down the waterside walkway that runs along the north shore of
Lake Tohopekaliga, where you’ll come across fishing piers, a wide variety of birds, and maybe even a gator chilling in the water.
SPIRIT OF THE SWAMP AIRBOAT RIDES | KISSIMMEE
(about 5 miles from Silver Spurs arena)
If you want to dive (not literally, do NOT dive into the water) even further into the Florida nature scene, consider booking an airboat ride through
Spirit of the Swamp
. They have one-hour tour options so you won’t have to carve out an entire afternoon to explore, but you’ll still get propelled into the marshes to have closer encounters with alligators and other other creatures. After coming face-to-face with a gator, a Jiu-Jitsu competitor might feel even less threatening!

MUSEUM OF MILITARY HISTORY | KISSIMMEE
(about 11 miles from Silver Spurs Arena)
Kissimmee is a stone’s throw away from all kinds of tourist destinations, but the
Museum of Military History
definitely flies under the radar (pun intended), sitting just southeast of the Disney complex. Featuring exhibits highlighting old military uniforms, weaponry, historical photos and other artifacts, the museum’s archives date back as far as the Revolutionary War. An enlightening look into the past, consider exploring this museum if you find yourself with extra time on your hands outside the IBJJF Championship.
ORLANDO CITY SC AT EXPLORIA STADIUM | ORLANDO
(about 24 miles from Silver Spurs Arena)
If you’re interested in exploring athletics outside of BJJ while in Kissimmee, you’ll have an opportunity to check out Orlando City, SC, a professional soccer club that plays in downtown Orlando at Exploria Stadium. This year, they have a
match scheduled against Chicago Fire FC
on Saturday, April 9th at 12pm. While Exploria Stadium isn’t particularly close to the tournament site, spectators or athletes who have time on their hands may be interested in making the journey north to cheer on the Lions.
TRAIN
KISSIMMEE MUSCLE GYM | KISSIMMEE
(about 7.5 miles from Silver Spurs Arena)
Proper exercise can be another tricky thing to maintain while traveling, especially when hotel fitness room equipment is often lacking. If you’re hoping to get in some good lifting sessions while you’re in Kissimmee for Pan, we’ve pinpointed a couple options for you where they have short-term membership options to accommodate travelers. First is
Kissimmee Muscle Gym
– this 24 hour facility has one day ($25) and one week ($55) membership options that you can even sign up for online.
ORLANDO BARBELL | ORLANDO
(about 29 miles from Silver Spurs Arena)
A bit further away from Silver Spurs Arena, Orlando Barbell is another great gym option for Jiu-Jitsu athletes and spectators in Kissimmee for the IBJJF Championship. Though 24 hour access is only available for enrolled members, Orlando Barbell does offer a $15 daily pass that can be used during staffed hours (MWF 10-noon and 4-7:30pm, Tues/Thurs 2-6pm, Sat/Sun 9am-2pm).

CELEBRATE
VINTAGE VINO | KISSIMMEE
(about 3 miles from Silver Spurs Arena)
Bringing home a BJJ championship and want to get the party started before you leave? If you fancy something…well, fancy,
Vintage Vino
might be the best place for you to raise a glass. Along with an expertly curated wine list, they have various events throughout the week, like craft beer night on Wednesdays, and a Friday happy hour with $4 wines and $4 beers from 5-7pm.
CHEERS SPORTS BAR | KISSIMMEE
(about 10 miles from Silver Spurs Arena)
If fancy is absolutely NOT what you want, then
Cheers Sports Bar
might be more your speed for some post-tournament libations. The self-proclaimed best sports bar in Kissimmee and the Yelp-proclaimed #1 dive bar in Kissimmee, Cheers offers up darts, pool, shuffleboard, a daily happy hour, and not a lot of fuss. Head in for cold, cheap beer and to mingle with the locals, not the tourists.

. In a game that came down to a matter of seconds in overtime, it was the Chiefs’ planning for OT rules that helped lead them to victory.
Preparation doesn’t just matter in a championship football game, it matters when running a business. Here are 3 easy ways to ensure that, as a Kicksite customer, you’re fully prepared to bring on new students and establish winning operations for your martial arts school in any scenario.
1 | Set up Membership templates
Memberships are the core of your students’ activity, giving you the best way to bill them, get them checked in, and connect them to a program. Plus, you can easily add memberships to a Landing Page so new students are able to select their preferred membership right away! By setting up all of your membership offerings through membership templates, you’re building a strong foundation for various parts of the system and keeping your students organized.
GET STARTED >>
2 | Create an Agreement template
Memberships are a key starting point for a new student, but having a proper signed waiver is also crucial for anyone training in your facility. By setting up an agreement template, you can have something ready to sign as soon as someone signs up. And yep, these can go on landing pages too! Agreement templates are extremely customizable and can even include multiple signature lines for full coverage and to accommodate minor students.

In 2024, Kicksite was proud to announce a new partnership with
We Defy Foundation
. A registered 501(c)3, We Defy Foundation’s mission is to provide combat veterans coping with military connected disabilities a long term means to overcome their challenges through Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and fitness training. We’re strong advocates of the work they do and the positive impact they have on veterans and the world of martial arts alike. We took some time to pick the brain of Executive Director Kevin Linderman to learn more about their history, accomplishments, and what’s in store for the future!
Tell us a little bit about the history of We Defy Foundation – how the organization came to fruition and the inspiration behind it.

The We Defy Foundation is celebrating 10 years of fulfilling our mission of providing therapeutic relief for disabled combat veterans through Jiu Jitsu. Starting in 2015, Professor Alan Shebaro and disabled combat veteran Joey Bozik recognized the impact Jiu Jitsu had on building quality of life, connecting to a positive community, inspiring and encouraging healthier living, and reminding oneself that regardless of your situation, you’re still in the fight.
The recognition of this powerful impact sparked the movement that is now the We Defy Foundation. Since the organization’s inception, We Defy has grown from funding one veteran at a time through individual seminars, to onboarding 35-40 veterans per month into the year-long scholarship program. The organization has provided over 1600 scholarships, has grown its approved gym network to over 1000 gyms nationwide, and supports nearly 600 veteran athletes training at any given time thanks to our dedicated force of volunteer ambassadors.
Why do you think Jiu-Jitsu has proven to be such an effective outlet and activity for disabled combat veterans?
There are many unique components to Jiu Jitsu that we believe impact disabled combat veterans in such a profound way. Starting with the scholarship itself. The scholarship is really an opportunity for the veteran to heal themselves. There’s some wonderful organizations out there doing great work for the veteran community. But many times it’s something that they are doing for the veteran, not what the veteran is doing for themselves. Our scholarship recipients get in the car, take themselves to the gym, walk onto the mats and engage in voluntary suffering at least 2 times per week. Through this process, the magic happens.
Next we have the gym environment. The gym is a familiar place to our veterans. The comradery, the smells, the sounds, it’s all reminiscent of a place they are familiar with. There’s a ranking system that is comforting to veterans. To strap on a white belt and be a newbie again is both humbling and freeing of expectations. On the mat, you know your place in the universe.
Next you have the professor and the system. There is a person that has the knowledge and a system that you need to learn that has been honed for years. It works if you do it correctly and at the right time. You learn that there are ways to get yourself out of dire predicaments. And you learn that you have more resilience than maybe you thought you did. And if it all fails, you know you can tap and start again. These lessons translate off the mat. The tap builds trust with your fellow training partners. And all the things that are bothering you off the mat stop when someone is trying to choke you out. You necessarily have to focus on the task at hand. For many, this pause in the rumination cycle is really where the mental health resiliency starts to take place. You get a break from what haunts you and then can slowly start to process things again until the next time you train, and then you can get another break.
All this to say that the We Defy program uniquely provides an opportunity for the veteran to heal themselves through the practice of Jiu Jitsu.
If you had to estimate (or even if you have an exact number!): since its inception, how many veterans has We Defy Foundation helped through scholarships and connecting them with Jiu-Jitsu academies?
To date We Defy has completed over 1600 scholarships. It’s really in the last 3 years or so that the organization has been able to ramp up significantly to onboarding 35-40 veterans per month. At any given time we have over 600 athletes training at approved gyms across the country.
What would you consider to be the biggest accomplishments or proudest moments for We Defy Foundation over the years?
Probably the biggest accomplishment is making it 10 years as a veteran non-profit organization. And not only making it 10 years, but excelling and growing year over year with an all volunteer workforce. Second to that would have been receiving the VA Adaptive Sports grant for the first time in 2022. This was really an acknowledgement for us that the VA was recognizing the value of the We Defy program. It meant a lot to Alan Shebaro and the rest of the team that we had achieved this goal. One other extremely proud moment was when we crossed the 1000 completed athlete scholarships milestone. This was a huge moment for the organization to recognize the ever growing impact on the lives of our veteran community.
You were recently named the Executive Director for We Defy Foundation. What does this mean for you and for the future of the organization?
This role means everything to me. It’s strangely what I’ve been unknowingly headed towards my entire professional career. I served on the board for almost 5 years prior to accepting this position, so I am intimately familiar with how it works. All my skills that I’ve gathered in various jobs and pursuits come to bear with this position. This was really a win/win for myself and for the organization. I’m familiar with everyone, I have established a solid rapport through my efforts over the years, and I was ready to take the position as Executive Director in order to shepherd in this new era of We Defy. To be honest, we just have grown too much to be run purely by part time volunteers. Many could not believe we had reached the scale we did without a single employee. My charter is enable the three pillars of our strategic plan, growth, sustainability and impact. Grow so we can handle 75-100 or more veterans per month. Ensure we have recurring donor revenue streams to sustain our program as well as the people, process and technology that is required to execute the program. And lastly, prove that what we do works by scientifically demonstrating our impact.
June is PTSD Awareness Month, and We Defy Foundation has a lot of anecdotal stories showing that training Jiu-Jitsu has helped veterans with their PTSD. But you all are now doing the work to establish evidence-based research that supports this as well. Tell us more about the study you are working on.
We are excited to say that UT Southwestern here in Dallas is running the largest study to date focused on the impact of BJJ on disabled combat veterans and their ability combat military connected disabilities.
The study will be ongoing for the next 2 years and will be a mixed-method design leveraging assessments of depression, anxiety, and trauma symptoms, as well as civilian transition and functional status. Veteran athletes will also be interviewed qualitatively with the intent of learning about unique contexts for the results, truing-up We Defy’s understanding of what’s occurring along the timeline of the program and identifying future areas to evolve in other subsequent phases of the study.
All of this is in support of our effort to demonstrate the impact of the We Defy program on the veteran community and grow it’s capability to fulfill a vision where ALL disabled combat veterans are empowered to heal, thrive, and engage through the practice of Jiu Jitsu, fostering their physical and mental well-being, community connection, and self-reliance. The study will also foster engagement and awareness of the We Defy program within academic medicine, as well as spark new opportunities to engage with the scientific community and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
A key component of your scholarship program is the network of schools that host and train We Defy Foundation athletes. How many academies are part of that network and what criteria does a gym need to meet to participate?
The
approved academies
are the core of the We Defy program. The academies provide the venues for healing through Jiu Jitsu. They also support our grassroots fund raising efforts by holding open mats and seminars that raise funds for our scholarship program. Currently we are right around 1000 approved training facilities in all 50 states, 2 US provinces, Guam and I think Belgium now if I’m not mistaken. We can’t thank these gyms owners and professors enough for what they do for our veteran community. We could not do what we do without the gym network.
Along with your network of training facilities, you also have an Ambassador Program. What does that program entail and how have Ambassadors helped advance the mission of We Defy Foundation?
Other than myself, we are an all volunteer led organization. The
ambassador program
for We Defy is, for many individuals, a second or third full-time job. I’m personally humbled by the amount of time, hard work and dedication that our ambassador corps dedicates to the mission of We Defy. They do it because they know it’s good. Our mission is good and we know it works, as many ambassadors have trained BJJ and or even gone through the We Defy program and are motivated to help the next veteran in line. Ambassadors play many key roles in the organization. From oversight of our athlete scholarship program, to offering mentorship roles to shepherd our veteran athletes through the one-year program, to fund-raising to logistics to, you name it…everything is done by the hearts and hands of volunteers. Our 400+ ambassadors are why we are so successful at what we do. It’s all about these group of dedicated men and women. Just an unbelievable group of people that I’m honored to be associated with.
Is there anything else new and exciting that We Defy Foundation is working on that you can tell us about (or even hint at)?
There’s lots going on for sure. I’m not ready to go public with one of the most exciting partnerships We Defy has had to date. But that will come out soon enough. Other than that, we have our gala coming up in Dallas on September 20. Be on the lookout for tickets and sponsorship opportunities for this fantastic event. This year is shaping up to be one heck of good time. I’m already getting excited about it.

For decades, Westside Barbell has been known as one of the best strength training gyms in the country. Founded by
Louie Simmons
, many high-level athletes have trained with Westside, achieving greatness in powerlifting thanks to Simmons’ Conjugate Method training system. But now, the renowned weightlifting gym is adding none other than combat sports to their repertoire. In what has been a long, extraordinarily detailed plan developed over the course of many years, the Westside Barbell team is looking to make their mark in martial arts with a perspective and history unlike anyone else’s. Check out our Q&A with Westside Barbell CEO Tom Barry as we dive deeper into how moving heavy metal with purpose and precision can translate to dominating on the mats.
What first made you interested in expanding Westside Barbell’s reach into the combat sports world?
I think Westside Barbell has been both directly and indirectly in the combat sports world for a long time. When I first came here, one of the first athletes I ever worked with was
Matt Brown
, who was a UFC fighter, as well as Kevin Randleman, Mark Coleman, John Saylor, and a series of different fighters were coming through. There’s always been fighters and grapplers around Westside. And Louie was a humongous fight fan. I would say his analysis of boxing and combat sports was second to powerlifting. So, it’s always been in our DNA and we were there really at the start when the UFC started to explode with Matt, and we got a good understanding of how to interpret our system and how it fits greatly within combat sports.
Retired UFC fighter Matt Brown training with Tom Barry at Westside Barbell.
I think we’re just now showing people the lineage and the types of strength training we have. We just didn’t put it out. And one of the biggest reasons for that is Louie believed you should spend 10 years in your sport before you start writing and putting it out there. Long story short, we want to make it more and put it out there more with 15 years of experience directly with combat athletes.
For some it’s new, but for us, we’ve been in this for a long, long time.
What has the process been like to dive into this new endeavor? Any surprises along the way?
Yeah, there was. For us, the system of training we use is the Conjugate Method, pioneered and popularized from Louie. We took the same foundations and from about 2011-14, we started to refine it more for combat sports. Some of the biggest changes that we made was that his system is based on four main days. We reduced it down to three main days and a day for martial arts training. It surprised us how effective it was – but it all stemmed from conversations from Louie. It’s been pretty rewarding, and due to the feedback we’re getting from combat athletes, has been huge. We’re learning from the pros and are constantly adapting. Over a period of 4-5 years, we refined it and got a baseline of what works, what doesn’t work.
Do you believe there are particular advantages Westside Barbell has in the combat sports world compared to other strength training programs? If so, what?
There’s many advantages, but I would say one of the biggest advantages is that we have a system based on practical results. A big part of our training is about absolute strength development – which a lot of people really are trending away from. Absolute strength is the rising tide that raises all ships. This also pushes strength endurance and maximum effort – a core of our philosophy. That’s how we have grapplers who weigh 150-170 pounds come to absolute divisions (weightless division class) and hold their own because they have a high level of maximum strength throughout the whole range.
Then the other one is adaptability. Every week we know how strong and fast our athletes are and their weaknesses that need to be addressed. We put something in place that will actually correct that weakness and turn it into a strength. Our weekly feedback loop helps us adapt on the fly whenever is needed. We know how to break this all down and to make sure it transfers into combat sports and Jiu-Jitsu.
Westside Barbell has a storied history of developing powerlifters. What kind of overlaps do you see with weightlifting for strength and for combat sports? Where do they differ?
You can learn a heck of a lot from powerlifting because powerlifters are experts on bench, squat, and deadlift. Virtually every program that you train in is going to be involved around some sort of benching, squatting, and deadlifting. We took all the knowledge and the setups of how to execute these exercises correctly with technical proficiency to maximize returns. It differs from the strength endurance aspect of powerlifters or strength sports. Their job is to be as strong as possible. And when they go to a powerlifting meet, they know objectively how strong they are.
We had to alter that a little bit in that we tell our athletes to be strong as necessary – and there’s a big difference. To be as strong as necessary is pretty ambiguous, but we use a term called diminishing returns. We want to raise your level of absolute strength and strength endurance to the highest levels without hurting your martial arts skills. How do we know if we’re going too far? Well, if we’re getting any negative feedback such as, ‘Hey, my training is not going as good. I’m feeling tired. I’m feeling run down.’ Okay, we’ll scale back and we’ll work up the weaknesses to develop that level of strength again.
It’s about finding the perfect balance. For example, one of our athletes competed
57
times last year. So, we altered the training system to keep the strength up, but it didn’t diminish the actual Jiu-Jitsu competition aspect.
The Kicksite team had the honor of visiting Westside Barbell facilities in late 2024, when you were in the midst of some renovations and additions to specifically accommodate combat sports athletes. Tell us more about what you’ve created and how athletes will be utilizing it.
It all started when ADCC and CJI (Craig Jones Invitational) were going on at the same time. We saw what Craig Jones was doing with the pit and knew it was very unique. So, we ended up building out around a full 21×21 foot pit. It was easier said than done. But as soon as we put that in, it was game-changing in the sense that we can do strength conditioning while they can go roll and get immediate feedback of which exercises are carrying over to the mat, and which aren’t.
We just knew if we wanted to get real-time feedback and to show people we’re heavily invested into giving you the best strength training advice, we had to have a method for athletes to train in-house. Because without it, we’re relying on subjective feedback and we can’t see it. But as soon as they finish strength training, they’re in the pit rolling, grappling, and it’s been phenomenal for our feedback to further refine the strength conditioning systems.

You’ve also already been working directly with a number of Jiu Jitsu/combat sports athletes. Tell us about those athletes and how they’ve helped you carve out your plans for this expansion.
The turning point for Jiu-Jitsu was Dante Leon. When Dante came in, it gave us this inside look into what competitive professional Jiu-Jitsu was. He basically started everything and created a feedback loop about competitions and how everyone approaches training. Dante then brought Max Hanson as a training partner. We started refining the system for Jiu-Jitsu and we found that it’s the perfect marriage. I give Dante so much credit because we couldn’t refine it without him. He was the nucleus. But then others, including Vitor Oliveira, came to train here as well and gave even more feedback. Now we’re getting all these pro level competitors coming in and the feedback loop is getting better and better. Dante led this but we were also able to see Max’s process through MMA which helped us learn more and more.
What are your early expectations for your success in the combat sports venture?
Our early expectations are to establish ourselves as a trusted resource for strength conditioning. I would say we represent the blue-collar aspect of working hard during training and that it’s not supposed to be easy. If you’re a professional athlete, you are trying to be your best in the world. We want to share that education just like Louie did with powerlifting, to the combat sports and Jiu-Jitsu community. People can read our blogs, where we give out a lot of free information and explain what we’re doing with athletes and showing this is not just a training system that you can go do based on nothing. The whole idea of a good strength training program is to give the athlete more of themselves.
Are there any other long-term plans or ideas for continuing to grow this effort?
Our goal is to keep educating people on weightlifting and combat sports. We’re planning on launching a combat sports specific podcast that’s going into everything we’re doing for the athletes. As well as that, we’ll be releasing books, training guides, and online platform materials so people can follow along for workouts. But we’ve been working on this for three years specifically with Jiu-Jitsu combat sports. The hope is to  to create something new and continue to improve for our athletes through productive feedback.

David Heineman of
Stay Safe Martial Arts
built a haven in Mundelein, Illinois, for students of all ages to practice martial arts and self-defense. In his 30 years of training experience, he has competed on some of the biggest Jiu Jitsu stages, traveled to colleges to educate about domestic violence, collaborated with law enforcement agencies, built a following from educational self-defense videos, and much more. His passion for self-defense is endless as he continues to work so that everyone can protect themselves and their loved ones. We’re proud to power Stay Safe Martial Arts and David’s meaningful cause. Continue reading to dive deeper into David’s journey, inspiration, and advice for martial arts school owners!
First off, what started your martial arts journey? Did you expect practicing Tae Kwon Do would eventually lead to this path?
I started training in Tae Kwon Do when I was about 5 or 6 years old for no other reason than I wanted to be a Power Ranger. I was obsessed with that show and begged my mom to take me to a class. Here I am, 34 years old and still training. I honestly did not expect that I would have been training in the martial arts for this long, but I love it. I have the privilege to train across multiple disciplines under countless different instructors. There is so much to learn when it comes to fighting as a whole that I never truly lose interest; I just find myself going down one rabbit hole after another, and ultimately, that is what keeps me coming back.
How does martial arts training cross over into your passion for self-defense and vice versa?
The more I trained in martial arts, the more I trained for self-defense. I wanted to be able to protect myself. As I have gotten older, gotten married, and have recently become a father, the need to be able to protect myself and my family has never been more critical. Say what you want about self-defense, but at the end of the day, it is about fighting. The better you can fight, the better you can protect yourself. Obviously, you need to add in elements of self-defense, such as weapon defense, de-escalation, etc., but it boils down to your ability to physically fight. Even more reason to train in all combat systems.
What inspired you to travel across the nation to educate fellow instructors, college students, and law enforcement about self-defense?
When I was in college, I began teaching women’s self-defense after I had heard about some assaults that took place on campus. I started running these quite often throughout my 4 years of school, so it gave me time to really try things out and develop a program. Upon graduating, I wanted to take things a step further by traveling the country. For the next couple of years, I would spend a couple of months at a time traveling the country working with sororities across college campuses.
The presentations garnered more attention than I anticipated, and in the first couple of months alone, I presented to just around 100 sororities across the country. As a result of these presentations, I was able to speak with countless individuals who had been sexually assaulted and shared their stories with me. It was from these stories that I began developing my program even further to prepare women the best I can, should they ever find themselves in a similar situation. My inspiration has always been the survivors; those who have experienced the worst of the worst yet survived and are sharing their stories to help others.
I want to prepare people the best I can for life’s worst-case scenarios. The same goes for law enforcement. I have several officers who train with me on a regular basis so that they are prepared for their line of work. Law enforcement officers literally put their lives on the line every day, so I make sure that I do everything I can to help them feel safe and prepared.
Your Instagram has many videos on self-defense tips and techniques. When and why did you start delving into this content?
I started posting content during COVID as something to do. Slowly but surely,
my page started to gain some traction
, and then one day it just took off. I realized that this was a big opportunity for me to educate people on a massive scale. Obviously, nothing will ever beat training in person, but if I can provide people with some self-defense and safety tips to help prepare them for life’s worst-case scenarios, then I will do just that.
My ultimate goal and motivation with my content is to encourage people to find a local gym and to start training. I have received countless messages from people asking for help finding a gym or telling me I inspired them to take their first Jiu Jitsu or Boxing class, so I know what I am doing in regards to social media is working. As much as I would I want my socials to grow overall, I am happy knowing that my content has helped give people the courage to train.
How do you feel about the positive response and following you’ve gained through these videos?
It is great! Obviously there have been plenty of haters along the way, and there always will be. However, whenever I get a message from someone sharing a story with me or telling me I have encouraged them to start training, it makes it all worth it. Being that I am a local competitor and coach, I usually run into people who are fans of the content I put out, so it is always fun chatting with them or even competing/training with them. Social media can be a great thing, and by being involved with it to the extent that I am, it has opened the doors to a lot of opportunities. I have been able to travel the country and even out of the country to teach or train with some of the best out there. I never thought that making self-defense videos would lead to that.
What has been your favorite part about teaching self-defense? Is there a moment in particular you think fondly of?
I just love seeing the confidence people get in themselves when they learn how to fight. There was actually a moment recently that has stuck with me. I have a female student who started training with me in one of my women’s self-defense classes and then transitioned over to our striking class. She has been training with me now for almost a year, and her entire demeanor has changed. You can see her confidence when she walks into a room.
She rarely backs down from a challenge, and has even started coming to our sparring classes and recently joined the Jiu Jitsu classes (which consist mostly of men). It has been awesome watching her grow not only as a person, but also in her skills. Strong punches, beautiful kicks, and starting to get the hang of grappling. This is why I encourage people to train, because it gives you that sense of confidence. Knowing that you can physically protect yourself and you are not afraid to go hands-on if needed is something that everyone should have.
Lastly, do you have any advice for other instructors who want to start self-defense seminars or make an impact within their own community?
Train often, work with other instructors, and do not be afraid of being a “white belt” in something. Too often do I see instructors who are afraid to be proven wrong or feel that their way is THE way. You have to always be a student first. Experiment with techniques. Work with different instructors and different disciplines so that you can be as well-rounded as possible. In addition, study violence. In a world where people are always recording videos, we have an endless supply of fights that we can learn from, which allows us to develop a proper program. From there, start teaching. Even if you suck at first, you need to keep going. It takes time to really develop a smooth program, and you always have to be making adjustments.
Do you have any future goals ahead or words of wisdom?
I won’t say what yet, but I am working on a couple of projects that are self-defense related that I am excited about. One of them will be directed towards children, and being a father myself, I am very excited for this one. Other than that, go train!"

Mat Made
is a jack-of-all-trades company in the Jiu-Jitsu landscape. What started as a potential TV series to tell Jiu-Jitsu stories has grown into so much more. They have continued to
share inspiring success stories
while creating
the largest Jiu-Jitsu directory in the United States
. We had the opportunity to meet with Founder Kenny Kim to discuss Mat Made’s rapid growth, the work that’s been put in, and their future goals.
Q: How did Mat Made start?
Mat Made was born out of my own personal story. I had a rough upbringing and the only thing that kept me in line was training. The success I’ve gotten through life is from the mats. I wanted to tell that story how you didn’t need to have a silver spoon in your mouth to be successful.
My goal was to inspire people – especially those who look like me, went through adolescence like me, and who didn’t have anything. I wanted people to see this guy that is a high school dropout, tattooed, went to jail, and show them that it is possible to be successful in life.
Q: What feedback have you received from the Jiu-Jitsu community about the work you do?
When we first put out the
Docuseries
and we put the short stories out, I would get crazy DMs. For example, I had a DM from a veteran that I still have in my phone. “I had a pistol in my hand and was suicidal and saw one of your stories. I will be Mat Made and start Jiu-Jitsu tomorrow.” Those are the types of messages I get: “Because of you I started Jiu-Jitsu.” “Because of the stories I see you telling, I’m going to become a better person.”
Obviously it costs a lot of money to produce these videos, but once we saw the feedback we knew it was a necessity to do this. It started as a project to inspire people, but became a mission.
Q: How do you find people to tell inspiring stories about Jiu-Jitsu?
I had a lot of followers so it was as easy as that. I would post, “I need a story, I’m looking for an interesting story.” And my email and DMs would be flooded with stories and we would go through them. All the stories were inspiring. We chose ones that we thought were very impactful. The first was a domestic violence story, the second one was about PTSD, the third one was about a 73-year old grandma training, another one was about the American dream…. It was stories that we thought someone out there could watch and go, “That could be me.” And since it was (intended for) TV, we had to make sure it was a story they could tell in front of the camera and tell it for TV.
Q: Where do you see Mat Made growing?
The day I said I’m writing
my first book
was three years ago. So, as a company, a brand, an idea, three years is pretty young. It usually takes a company a minimum of five, six, eight, 10 years before they can become a household name. Especially for us, we have done that. The name Mat Made actually has become not only synonymous to me, but it has become a sub-brand that people already notice.
So now on my
Instagram
and
TikTok
channels, I share not only techniques, but I share some wisdom. I share 25 years of my training experience with them – what to do, what not to do. Some of those things are always tied into Mat Made.
I hope in the next three to five years we’re going to be somewhere bigger. I hope we can sign a TV deal with a big network, which we were close to once. We are continuing to work on our directory, which is the largest in the United States. We have our drink,
Tigerblood
. I have another book coming out and more. Another upcoming activity is our Masterminds event, where we’ll help business owners improve to be successful and spread positivity from Jiu-Jitsu. We want to be one of the biggest brands in Jiu-Jitsu that isn’t just for uniforms or one thing.
In the end, we want Mat Made to be on the forefront of people’s mind. We want to be the place people go when they need something. We connect people together. We’re connecting the brands to students and schools to the brands. It’s a full circle that we want to be a part of.
Q: How do you balance all the different facets that Mat Made has?
I still teach full-time, I still have to be a dad, I still have to be a husband. I still have to run my school with over 300 students, but there’s that old saying – “When you love what you do, you don’t work a day in your life.”
Q: Out of the stories that Mat Made has told, which have stood out to you the most?
There’s so many different stories on Matmade.com that are categorized in weight loss, stress, PTSD, etc. Every individual has a success story, but I think the biggest one is the boost of confidence, and to be able to get out of their comfort zones and try something brand new like Jiu-Jitsu, which is hard. Trying something new is hard to stick with. Everyone wants to quit.
So, for people to stick it out – one year, two years – become blue belts, black belts, and especially those in their 60s to become black belts after 10 years of training is impressive. Especially while younger people are making excuses. It’s the boost of confidence in having that never give up attitude. That’s a similarity in all the stories, no matter what their success story is.
That’s what parallels life. We run into bumps and bruises on the road. Life knocks us down. But what do we do? Most of us have to come right back up and get on our feet and continue moving. That’s exactly what these success stories are doing. Just continue to push forward and not give up.
Q: How have you kept your Jiu-Jitsu school database as current as possible?
We were the first one to scrape the information and form one of the largest directories. Now, we are in the process of training AI services to make phone calls to each and every gym on our database. If the information isn’t correct, they’ll actually go out and find it on Google, call them in real time, and have a real conversation. We did a test run and I was blown away.
We’re in the process of confirming all those schools and that their information is correct. Once that gets all done, people on the directory can make updates or add or delete information, they can always contact us and we’ll be able to get that done.
Q: What is the process going to be to verify a school on your website?
Right now we have a few schools verified on Mat Made. The verification process will be like this: We’ll be able to verify schools in a basic manner. You know, is this their website, phone number, address, etc. That’s the basic verification. If you want to get deeper into verification, it’ll be a paid service.
With the paid service, you can put whatever information you want on Mat Made: program information, pictures, videos, introductions, etc. And then you’ll become the top school within that city on Mat Made at the top of your geolocation section. The free version works well, but the paid service creates more exposure.
Q: How did you begin your Jiu-Jitsu journey and transition into Mat Made?
I have been in martial arts for all my life. When I was 20 years old, I opened up a Taekwondo Kickboxing school, and a buddy of mine wanted me to try Jiu-Jitsu. I got hooked and that’s where everything started. In the beginning I was young and stupid and just wanted to learn how to fight. As I got into the business side, the older I got, I realized the power Jiu-Jitsu has – how impactful it can be to transform people.
That’s how I transitioned to look at how Jiu-Jitsu is more than an art or a sport. I think a lot of martial arts are impactful, but Jiu-Jitsu is just on another grand scheme of things. It’s huge. And I wanted to be able to be the person that lays the bridge to connect people to Jiu-Jitsu."

Raquel Canuto owns Hybrid Jiujitsu in Las Vegas, Nevada with her partner Renato Canuto. The black belt world champion duo opened their academy in August 2021 as a venture that combines both of their visions and styles under one roof.
When did you first start martial arts? How did you get started?
My father was a lifelong martial artist so I grew up practicing martial arts but it wasn’t until I was a sophomore that I began taking it seriously. This is when I went out for the high school wrestling team and realized quickly this was what I wanted to do for my life.
When did you open your school? How did you know you wanted to do this?
My husband and I partnered with Venum on a project back in 2019. They opened a gym where we started our first program. After 2 years the gym closed so we opened Hybrid Jiujitsu in August of 2021. I knew for about 10 years before then that I wanted to someday have a gym of my own. I was fighting MMA at the time but prioritized doing Jiujitsu with the idea that one day when I was done fighting MMA I would be a black belt and have something to show for my career. At the time I didn’t know it would be a Jiujitsu school but that was the plan that life had for me. I still believe someday we will be a full-service school offering striking and other disciplines as well.
What is your proudest achievement so far?
My proudest achievement is Hybrid Jiujitsu. What we have been able to collectively create is so special and trumps any titles I have captured. We are changing lives daily and that means so much to me.
What are you shooting for next? Any big goals on or off the mat?
I am turning 34 this year so I am nearing the end of my career with plans to retire within the year so I can start a family. I am going to be doing some super fights on UFC Fight Pass, ADCC trials and the World Championships until then. I would like to make it to the ADCC World Championships! That’s the goal right now.
Give us a fun fact about yourself outside of training!
I am one of the hardest-working people I’ve ever known but really enjoy being lazy as well. Lounging with my dogs on the couch listening to or reading a book is my favorite thing to do.

December marks National Write a Business Plan Month. With the new year on the horizon, the timing is perfect – as the 12-month cycle restarts with the drop of a ball, small businesses are given the opportunity to establish goals and set agendas. Writing and formulating a business plan is vital for every small business. Whether you’re just getting started or working to grow, a solid business plan will have you organized and ready to manage finances, marketing, and so much more.
“I think it’s (writing a business plan) essential…we do it at Kicksite every year,” Kicksite CEO and Owner Jason Neef said. “Whether you’re a new business or you’re a long standing established business – we’ve been around almost 20 years, and every year, we go into the year with a plan. So, I’d say it’s mission critical to have a business plan each and every year.”
When creating a business plan, there isn’t just one route to roll with. Typically, there are many different paths you can take to set up your business for success. According to one of the greatest contributors to small business,

The resources from both the US SBA and Score are wonderful assets to explore during National Write A Business Plan Month and use in your small business journey, especially for martial arts school owners. Jason Neef has worked with martial arts businesses for nearly 20 years. He has seen what’s worked for martial artists to thrive as business owners and what has led to some failures. Here’s some tips for National Write a Business Plan Month to successfully execute your plan and grow your school.
Jason’s Martial Arts School Business Plan Advice
Define what is success to you
Success means different things to different people, and that’s okay! But before diving into a business plan (and ideally, before starting your business), you’ll establish that definition of success so you can shape your plan around it. If money and growth are your markers of success, then your plan should center on signing up more students, generating prospects, and converting those leads. If your idea of success is freedom and free time, then you’ll need to focus on building up more resources and people on staff so you can offload work and delegate tasks.
Be deliberate about your goals
Once you’ve defined your meaning of success, you’ll craft goals to help you get there. But these goals shouldn’t be overly broad or vague. Each goal should be crafted with the intention of pushing you further towards success. For example: If your idea of success is growth, what is your specific goal for new students gained per month?
Don’t have too many things going on
A focused business plan is a good one. Having 3-5 highly intentional goals vs. 10-15 broad ones allows you to hone in on what needs to be done to succeed. Things are less likely to get lost in the shuffle or forgotten, and you won’t feel stretched thin trying to make too much happen over the course of the year.
Include staff in business plan
Your idea of success and your goals can’t be successfully accomplished if you’re the only one who knows about them. As your support system, your staff should be fully aware of and aligned with what you’re aiming to achieve, and maybe just as important, HOW you plan to achieve it. With that knowledge, they can help by executing their roles with goal-driven intention.
Follow up consistently
Business plans aren’t “set it and forget it.” You should be revisiting your plan on a regular basis to evaluate how you’re progressing towards your goals. Consider what’s working, what isn’t, and what needs to be adjusted going forward. To make sure you’re following up as needed, set up calendar reminders on a monthly and quarterly basis to do your reviews."

Blogs are one of the
best ways to drive traffic to a website
, and also one of the least expensive techniques. The more content martial arts schools publish, the more likely potential students are to find them. While school owners may not think they have time to blog in addition to running their facilities, blogging does not require an extensive time commitment. School owners have a wealth of information, and they can establish themselves as thought leaders in the industry by blogging regularly. They can discuss the benefits of martial arts, interesting news or opportunities for competitions.
KEEP REGULARLY UPDATING YOUR WEBSITE WITH BLOG POSTS
Kicksite is proud to offer an all-in-one solution for our customers. This includes building a

This by no means needs to be a daily or even weekly occurrence. It can be monthly blogs about competitive updates, featuring an instructor, or discussing events within the community.
UTILIZE KEYWORDS AND BACKLINKS TO IMPROVE SEO
Writing relevant content that is valuable to viewers can improve search rankings. Increased traffic to the website will send a positive signal to search engines that visitors are finding the page useful, so the blog may appear higher in the results. Ultimately, this makes it easier for interested students to locate a martial arts school and enroll in classes.
To write a blog post that will improve your SEO there are two simple things to do: utilize keywords and link your sources. Utilizing keywords such as, “martial arts school” or “self-defense classes” is a simple way to increase your website’s traffic. Schools including relevant keywords in their content will be more likely to show up when potential customers are performing internet searches. The wider of variety keywords, the better.
Alternatively, link your sources, partnerships, and whatever else you can within your blogs. This creates
backlinks
to improve your website’s credibility and discoverability.
USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO GET MORE ATTENTION FOR BLOG POSTS
Since it can be difficult to attract readers to a blog, martial arts schools can leverage other tools to promote content and attract prospects, and engage current students. After publishing a blog post, martial arts schools should make a post with a link on Facebook and Twitter. If the school has social media followers, it’s a great way to attract more attention to the blog.
Conversely, the blog can be used to attract more Twitter or Facebook followers. Blog posts can include links to social media profiles to make it easy for prospective students to follow on multiple platforms. People who find the blog in search engine results may not be aware of the martial arts school’s social media presence."

SEO Basics
SEO seems to be one of the hottest buzz words and topics right now in the digital marketing world. According to
Semrush
, SEO is essentially the process of updating and maintaining your website to improve your Google Search rankings. Being ranked highly in Google Search improves your website’s visibility, and greatly increases your chances of potential consumers going to your website. There are so many things that impact a website’s search ranking, so in addition, here is a list that covers 11 different things you can do to improve your
website’s SEO
.

Google December 2022 Search Updates
In early December, Google released a big update that has the potential to greatly impact millions of websites. This update can either help or hurt your website. Let’s take a look at what it consists of, and what you absolutely need to focus on.
Google’s latest search update includes their
“automated ranking system”
which is designed to make sure consumers are getting the most original, helpful, people-first written content. So then what does this mean? Google is going to start making sure websites that are filled with content that is people-first will get rewarded, which is great! The downside of this update, is that websites created with intent to rank well in search, will start to get impacted negatively. This is actually very common to see in the website world. Companies will create your website, stuff it with keywords and written content designed to rank well, and use stock images across websites.
What can you do?
First, perform an audit of your website. Make sure you are aware of what type of content is on your website. Ask yourself: Did I create people-first content? Is it written as a resource to people coming to your website, giving them valuable information? Is the content descriptive and include unique descriptions? Remember, Google’s new update will be analyzing your website, if it thinks that your content is written to game the system, you could see negative results in your rankings.
Second, it can be very difficult to manage your website, make constant updates, and write unique, SEO friendly content, so make sure that you have a team or a company that can do all of that for you. Make sure that they do in fact write content that is people-first, and not written to try and game the Google Search System. Keeping up with SEO can be difficult, so it may be worth while to do your own SEO research, and ensure you stay up-to-date!

While some small-business owners avoid social media, it can be a useful strategy for martial arts schools to boost enrollment. Social networks amplify word-of-mouth reviews and act as a forum for other customers to share information about local organizations.
Martial arts schools can target potential students with social networks, particularly Facebook because users on this site supply a large amount of demographic and geographical information. Because many martial arts schools have a limited region where potential students may be, the hyperlocal targeting available through Facebook is a valuable way to find new prospects in a specific location, according to an article in Business 2 Community.
However, if a martial arts school is going to rely on Facebook ads to fuel their social media strategy, they need to have a well-developed profile on the site. The article recommended directing viewers from an ad to a Facebook page to keep the user experience similar. If the profile has relevant content about the school, the page can act as a useful marketing tool. However, if information is sparse or incomplete, it could immediately send prospective students away from the page. Additionally, Facebook does not offer a tool to calculate return on investment, so if schools choose to utilize this advertising channel, it can be difficult to measure results.
Is social media right for your martial arts school?
Some small organizations are reluctant to make the move to social media because few consumers use these networks as a major factor in their
decisions to purchase a product or service
, The Denver Business Journal stated. However, people do use Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to discover companies and develop a relationship with an organization. This can prove to be especially useful for martial arts schools because part of the reason a student may choose to enroll for classes or a membership is because he or she feels a connection to the organization and instructors.
While social media advertising can be an effective technique for many organizations, martial arts schools can benefit from using these sites as a relationship-building tool. If schools attempt to use it as a direct sales tools, they may not see the results they wanted. Whether school owners are managing their online presence or not, negative reviews can already exist. Social media gives martial arts schools a chance to respond and improve their Internet reputation."

Forty-nine percent of nearly 1,300 of young people between 14-24 who participated in a recent study by MTV and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research admitted to
having experienced digital abuse
.
While this number is down seven percentage points from a similar survey in 2011, bullying is still a major problem affection millions of kids and teenagers throughout the country.
Finding ways to deal with abuse from peers is critical for students to be able to get through school. Seventy-two percent said deleting their social network profile made the situation better, while 66 percent saw an improvement after talking about it with their parents. However, it may be a better idea for students to build up their mental strength to prevent bullying before it starts.
Learn Tae Kwon Do to stop bullying
No student likes to be bullied and it can often be easier to get in a child’s head if they feel helpless against those who are picking on them. Taking part in some Tae Kwon Do training can fix this problem and give students some confidence to stand up to their bullies.
Here are some tips from the American Tae Kwon Do Association on how
martial arts
can help to combat bullying:
1. Stay calm in the face of a bully:
Part of learning Tae Kwon Do is being able to control one’s mind. This is extremely important when confronting a bully who is trying to instigate a problem. Understanding how to stay calm will not only frustrate a bully, but allow a student to become less of a target.
2. Be as friendly as possible:
Students who take Tae Kwon Do class will find it easy to make friends in class if they come in with the right attitude. It’s important to have the same mindset at school. Students must be open to making new friends, which can greatly reduce the chances they get picked on by a bully.
3. Help others who are facing bullies:
One quick way students can use to show bullies that they are not afraid of them is to stick up for their friends who are being teased. Bullies like to pick on the easy targets, and students who have learned Tae Kwon Do will have more confidence to be able to defend themselves and their friends from anyone."

Practicing Tae Kwon Do has long been thought of as a way to help children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder learn how to focus and improve their performance in school. Trying
martial arts
is better for kids than leaning on prescription drugs, which is why many parents have enrolled their offspring in Tae Kwon Doe training programs. Stimulants used to treat ADHD like Ritalin and Adderall that have been around for years are now in question. Are they actually helping students improve their performance in school? Researchers aren’t convinced.
Janet Currie, an author of a working paper published on the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and her team studied nearly 4,000 students in Quebec for an average of 11 years. The results showed that boys who took ADHD drugs did not perform as well in school than those with similar symptoms who were not medicated, while girls taking the medicine experienced more emotional problems, reported The Wall Street Journal.
“The possibility that [medication] won’t help them [in school] needs to be acknowledged and needs to be closely monitored,” Currie, who is also an economics professor and director of the Center for Health & Wellbeing, a health policy institute at Princeton University, told the newspaper.
Could Tae Kwon Do be the answer?
While no martial arts expert will say that taking Tae Kwon Do classes will cure students of ADHD, many would attest to the fact that it certainly be a way to help young people cope with the illness. ADDitude magazine shared a story about a young girl named Abbey who was able to greatly benefit from taking Tae Kwon Do classes.
As a child, Abbey struggled with patience. She quickly grew tired of piano lesson and gymnastics, while soccer was too fast paced for her. This is when her parents entered her into martial arts class, which turned out to be a perfect match. At Tae Kwon Do class, she was able to build friendships with other students and her parents saw her confidence levels skyrocket. Not only was she excelling in martial arts, she was also beginning to turn it around in school.
In her martial arts lessons, Abbey learned how to set high goals for herself. She translated this lesson to her school work. Her new “can-do” attitude made it easier to put her difficulties in school behind her. Parents with children struggling with ADHD should definitely think about getting their kids involved in Tae Kwon Do."

When frustrations at work run high, it’s important for professionals to be able to find a way to unwind. Which is why tae kwon do training is a great idea for those wanting to let off some steam after work.
“There are many reasons for feeling stressed at work, but those who feel like they’ve been able to have control over their careers and work in a field they’re truly passionate about, end up being more satisfied and productive,” said John Swartz, regional director of career services at Everest College.
According to the April 2013 Work Stress Survey conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of Everest College, 83 percent of the more than 1,000 Americans who were surveyed by phone said they
become stressed by at least one thing at work
, with 14 percent saying their unreasonable workload was one of the main reasons why they get worked up about their career.
Embracing the stress relieving power of tae kwon do can help Americans ensure that work issues don’t leave the office.
Relax away stress with tae kwon do
The mental and physical aspects of tae kwon do can be extremely effective in stress relief.  Not only can practicing tae kwon do contribute to better physical health, but it can also help the brain relax and offers a distraction from the struggles that come along with a demanding job.
Sixteen percent of professionals who make more than $100,000 per year said that their commute can be their biggest frustration. Heading to tae kwon do class right after work will break up their travel time and be a contributing factor in reducing stress.
Tae kwon do can lead to a healthy diet
When people are stressed, they tend to rely on food to help them feel better. However, by allowing tae kwon do to help relieve frustrations, Americans can eat healthier. Having a strong mix of exercise, family life and work can provide a balance the balance that professionals need to make the right decisions when it comes to their diet. Eating more nutritious food will lead to better performance in the workplace, as well as improved overall health."

We recently announced Kicksite’s partnership with the wonderful people at
Tap Cancer Out
and were honored to contribute to their
Global Grappling Day
fundraiser. The work they put in for the fight against cancer and with the Jiu-Jitsu community is highly admirable. We were able to meet with Founder and Executive Director Jon Thomas to discuss his story and how Tap Cancer Out has became a pillar in the Jiu-Jitsu community.
Q: What inspired you to start Tap Cancer Out?
I first came up with the idea in 2010 after attending the
Classy Awards
for nonprofits to support a friend. It was a really humbling experience and inspiring to listen to how all these people were changing the world. I had a reflective moment where I looked at myself thinking ‘What am I doing to make this world a better place?’ The answer was simple: Nothing.
At the event I told myself I wouldn’t leave without coming up with an idea. So, I decided to combine my passion for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and hatred for cancer. I have lost a number of family members and friends to cancer, including my nephew at 10 months in 2006. That heartbreaking memory was still fresh in my mind and heart, and is still today. I knew to combine the two but didn’t know how. I’ve learned that the key to starting something is to not worry about the perfect pathway, but just to set a goal and get started. And that’s what I did and how Tap Cancer Out was started.
Q: What has led to your massive growth since beginning?
Because it is difficult for the average person to jump into nonprofit efforts, working with and empowering the Jiu-Jitsu community is huge for our growth. Lots of organizations host events for nonprofits, and they’re great. But, if there’s not that passion for an event or activity, it’s really hard to make that an annual thing. It’s important for the events to be something people want to participate in over and over again. The passion in the Jiu-Jitsu community alongside the generosity of others has propelled us to where we are now.
Q: How does it feel to see the work you put in impacting so many lives?
It’s the greatest honor of the job. It’s amazing to see something you create grow and affect so many people in a positive way. It really is the best. When I first started Tap Cancer Out I had no idea it’d grow to where it is now, and I never dreamed it’d be a full-time thing. I thought it’d be more of a side hustle that was my way of giving back. But each year we continued to add more and more tournaments and had more work to do. Eventually, I got tired of the office life and was always thinking about Jiu-Jitsu and Tap Cancer Out. Now I get to exert all my energy into work that truly makes a difference.
Q: What feedback, praise, etc. have you heard from the Jiu-Jitsu community?
We receive a ton of feedback from the Jiu-Jitsu community. Most of it is very positive on our tournaments, but we’re not perfect. We’ll hear advice on how to run tournaments, opinions on Gi or No Gi, tournament styles, etc.
We also hear how appreciative people are of our tournaments and our efforts. Jiu-Jitsu is a way to block out the world. Before your typical round you won’t hear, ‘My mom has breast cancer.’ It’s just not Jiu-Jitsu conversation. Our tournaments do give people the unique opportunity to talk, remember, grieve, and share their stories.
People love the opportunity to compete while fighting for those in the fight of their lives and not worrying about placement. I hear from some people that they Tap Cancer Out are the only tournaments they compete with how we are very organized and to help make a difference. That’s something we love to hear as we try to change the world through our love of our sport.
Tap Cancer Out’s Danvers, MA Tournament, November 2024
Q: Prior to Tap Cancer Out, what was your experience with Jiu-Jitsu and how did it impact your life?
Prior to Tap Cancer Out, I was just a regular Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. I was a regular two-three time-a-week kind of guy which has now led to so much more. Beforehand, I had only been training for two years when I came up with the idea. I wasn’t a seasoned black belt, head referee, academy owner, or any of that. I’d certainly never hosted a Jiu-Jitsu tournament, certainly never ran a nonprofit. I was sort of ignorant to all of that and not aware. But, I wasn’t going to let that stop me. I did compete a lot in those few years so I understood how the tournaments were run and was confident in my inner circle to help make everything work.
Q: How have your tournaments improved throughout time?
We’ve now hosted around 120 events. We’ve made some changes throughout time, Gi and No Gi, organization, etc. Also, the size of the tournaments has increased so much more, bringing on more divisions and other changes. We always have followed the IBJJF rules so there’s certain things that have never changed and may never will.
The little things continue to improve, and we are always listening to feedback from others and the community. We’ve taken some things from Master Worlds to improve, leading to me literally using a box cutter on our mats to create more room and seperate divisions. We are always adapting to provide the best experience for everyone to compete in and encourage the fight against cancer.
Q: How did the inspiration to make
Global Grappling Day
a big fundraising day come about?
I literally came up with that idea on the Peloton. It was during 2020 and we had to cancel multiple events due to the pandemic. Without events, we were struggling to donate to our beneficiaries and even just keep the company afloat. Thinking about that, I came up with using Global Grappling Day as a fundraiser day, but still needed it to involve at least more than one person with social distancing.
That’s when I took inspiration from my black belt test. For my test I had to roll for an hour with other brown and black belts revolving every two minutes. It was something that was tough but not impossible. So, if everyone can find one person to roll with, they could stay home and help contribute to our cause with one hour of rolling (some small breaks expected of course). Our first event raised $275,000 and it’s kind of become a Jiu-Jitsu holiday. That was just the start of it, and I hope it becomes similar to Black Friday, Super Bowl Sunday, etc., where you say it and know what it is.
Q: Earlier this year, Tap Cancer Out was the premiere charity partner of the inaugural
Craig Jones Invitational
. How did that come to be and how did it feel to generate such a significant donation through that event?
Once I heard about the Craig Jones Invitational, I knew Craig Jones was creating an event to reward the athletes, raise the attention of the sport, bring in new fans, and do everything differently. It reminded me when we started hosting our tournaments to make the world a better place. My hope was charity would be a part of it, and once he announced it would on Joe Rogan it was all hands on deck. This is what we had worked toward the past decade and we knew it had to be us.
I reached out to Rich Byrne, CEO of
KASAI Elite Grappling
, to support Tap Cancer Out to work with the CJI. Rich went above and beyond, telling Craig he’d match the donation himself for Tap Cancer Out, with a third anonymous supporter of our’s matching it as well. It ended up being the perfect fit between us and the CJI. They ended up donating $166,666.66, which got multiplied by three, reaching $500,000. We don’t ever get donations like that so it was very special. It is very transformational to our business and what we can accomplish can continue to grow.
Everything they do from the charitable element, paying the fighters, and how they run the event itself is huge for the Jiu-Jitsu community and is very impactful. We are very thankful for how they have helped us grow.

Q: What made you want to partner with Kicksite?
We are very careful who we partner with. We want to make sure we are partnering with great people who are working hard in the Jiu-Jitsu world. We’re always trying to work with brands who understand and are highly invested in the community. With all the work Kicksite does to make the day-to-day academy life better, it was a great fit.
Q: What is your favorite part about leading Tap Cancer Out?
There’s a lot that I love about what I do. I love that I can be really proud to tell my kids what I do. I’m super proud to show them what we’re (my wife and I) doing and why we work so hard and what we’re doing to help others. The work I do will obviously never bring my nephew back, but maybe we’ll save another family from what we had to go through as a family.
Also, it’s the greatest honor to hear stories from the Jiu-Jitsu community and help in the healing process. It’s really humbling because it filled a place in my heart that was empty in 2010 when I wasn’t working to change the world. I haven’t fixed the world or solved cancer, but I know myself, my wife, and my whole staff has done as much as we can to make this world a better place.
Q: What is your proudest achievement with Tap Cancer Out?
The knee-jerk reaction is to say the donations we have given to
our beneficiaries
. The $7.75 million donated is something to be proud of. But, what I think I am most proud of is simply starting Tap Cancer Out. As they say in Jiu-Jitsu, the most important belt you get is the white belt. Similarly to starting Jiu-Jitsu, I didn’t know what I was doing when I started Tap Cancer Out. I just kept on going and eventually it’s 10 years later and you get to see everything that you’ve accomplished. I can’t believe how far Tap Cancer Out has come. I’ve quit plenty of things in life so I’m proud I kept going."

Action films have changed a lot over the years. CGI, explosions, and intense shootouts have swept through Hollywood, often taking the place of the practical effects and intricacies that action scenes were once rooted in.
Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean true hand-to-hand fights on film are gone – or forgotten! Plenty of movies, old and new, showcase high-level martial arts to depict a battle between two or more opponents. And who doesn’t love a tense, realistic fight while enjoying a film or TV show? Check out some of the best martial arts fight scenes in movies, covering the old, the new, and showcasing various disciplines, styles, and emotions.
Top 10
Martial Arts Fights in Movies
The Way of the Dragon
(1972) –
Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris
Isn’t this a perfect way to get started? Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris are two pioneers who brought martial arts to the big screen. Their duel in
The Way of the Dragon
is a back-and-forth slugfest, highlighted by numerous kicks with some punches thrown in for good measure. The end of the fight shows Lee’s characters attacking pressure points and ending the iconic battle between two legends. This showdown between Jeet Kune Do and Tang Soo Do/Karate does not disappoint.
Ip Man (2008)
–
Ip Man vs. 10 Men
This classic martial arts fight scene takes place in the film during the Japanese invasion of China. Donnie Yen’s Yip Man looks to avenge the death of his friend, challenging 10 Karate black belts to fight him all at once. One by one, he takes down each opponent with brutal punches and kicks. His Wing Chen expertise allows him to walk away unscathed as everyone lies beaten around him.
Mission Impossible: Fallout
(2018) –
Ethan Hunt and August Walker vs. Lark Decoy
The
Mission: Impossible
franchise is full of iconic scenes, and this is up at the top. Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill’s characters battle it out with a stunt double and Wu Shu Champion, Liang Yang. There are a series of elbows, kicks, throws, and even use of impromptu weapons. The fight – which destroys a men’s restroom – highlights how you can be outnumbered and smaller than your opponents, but keep up in the end.
John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum
(2019) –
John Wick vs. Two Shinobi
The
John Wick
franchise has so many spectacular fights that it’s hard to pick just one, but we’re partial to this fun side battle. The Baba Yaga faces off against two of the main antagonists’ students before the 1-on-1 duel. They give him the ultimate respect throughout, allowing him to stand up when he’s been knocked down. Using only his belt, the legendary mercenary takes on the two highly skilled fighters who are armed with knives. He uses a variety of Judo, Jiu-Jitsu, and striking techniques, showing them the legend is real.
Drunken Master II
(1994) –
Jackie Chan vs. Ken Lo and Ho-sung Pak
Jackie Chan as Wong Fei-hung puts together one of the most unique fights in cinema. Facing off in a 1v2 (mostly just against Ken Lo), Chan applies the Drunken Boxing method – simply put, imitates the movements of a drunk man. He goes up against Lo’s Taekwondo and deals with Park adding fire into the mix. He then proceeds to become intoxicated in an unorthodox way, establishing his prowess and finishing up the flashy fight in style.
Undisputed II: Last Man Standing
(2006) –
George “Iceman” Chambers vs. Yuri Boyka
Michael Jai’s George Chambers is sent to a Russian prison to take on fighting champion Yuri Boyka. In this battle, he is fighting for his freedom. The bout starts with each using plenty of Kickboxing and Boxing techniques. Nevertheless, Chambers’ mentorship from a fellow inmate provides him the grappling skills necessary to gain the upper hand, ending the intense fight with a damaging leg lock. The action scene serves as one of Jai’s most exciting fights in his acting career.
Shang-Chi
(2021) –
Shang-Chi vs. Death Dealer
Through all the CGI fights and superpower-driven battles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they still managed to put together an all-time hand-to-hand fight in 2021. And it only makes sense that it was during Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, a film whose title character is known as the Master of Kung Fu in the comics. During this faceoff, each character shows their strong martial arts skills with and without a weapon. The kicks, punches, and slick choreography sets it at the top of the MCU’s hand-to-hand fights.
Flash Point
(2007) –
Donnie Yen vs. Collin Chou
We have a second Donnie Yen fight on the list. Yen shows his versatility against Collin Chou with a style that’s notably different than what he put on display during his 1 vs. 10 battle in Yip Man. In
Flashpoint
, we get to watch the two use high-level Jiu-Jitsu to battle it out. The BJJ heavy fight begins to incorporate more strikes, elbows, and knees as the two proceed to tear apart the crumbling environment with their battle. Few fights use as many martial arts disciplines as this showdown.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
(2000)
–
Jen vs. Shu Lien
Few fights in cinema or media history use weapons better than Jen vs. Shu Lien. Jen is mastering the powerful Green Dragon sword when Shu Lien takes her on as tensions are rising. The two duel as Shu Lien uses countless weapons to attack but is continuously faltered by Jen’s sword skills. They battle it out with Jen proving victorious, no matter how many times Shu Lien grabbed a new weapon to fight. The weapon choreography is arguably the best you can find!
Fist of Fury (1972) –
Bruce Lee vs. The Hongkou Dojo
Once again we have a classic Bruce Lee, and once again, we have a one-man army scene. Lee takes on a whole Japanese dojo, starting with a series of kicks, throws, and punches. He then takes hold of a pair of nunchucks and no one has a chance. One by one they all go down and finally, he confronts the master. After a brief back and forth, Lee defeats him and makes a statement to the dojo. It’s easy to understand why so many say that Lee is the best!
Honorable Mentions
This list could go on for days – nearly everyone probably has their own personal list and would call out some snubs that were left off of the ten films noted above.
There are so many different action scenes that capture the art of martial arts. And sometimes it goes beyond great choreography. The narrative could be just as impactful – or even more so – than the small details of the fight. We can see a respect or anger between two opponents, or a determination to never give up against a herculean foe.
Here’s some other great action scenes, some even animated, that tell a deeper story, show a will to never quit, or are just plain out cool.
Rocky
(1976) –
Rocky Balboa vs. Apollo Creed
Is this fight realistic based on how a professional Boxing match looks? No. Is the choreography amongst the best in film? Not exactly. So why is it here? Few scenes perfectly capture a martial artist’s will to never give up and keep fighting as Rocky Balboa does against Apollo Creed. If you ever need an extra boost to get in the gym or put in extra drill work, turn on this classic!
Kill Bill: Vol 1
–
The Bride vs. The Crazy 88’s
Now, this scene is probably a little over the top. But in true Quentin Tarantino fashion, it works! Uma Thurman as Beatrix “The Bride” Kiddo takes on a gang of swordsmen in her pursuit of revenge. Her sword skills and superior blade overwhelm the entire group in a scene that’s shocking, chaotic, and unforgettable. She then takes on Lucy Liu’s character O-Ren Ishii, in a 1-on-1 sword battle, in another fight that deserves to be on this list.
Naruto Shippuden (2014) –
Kakashi vs. Obito
Keep in mind, this is a fight where super powers and animation come together. But that hardly means it can’t be a great martial arts duel! The hand-to-hand combat coupled with the storytelling of two friends turned enemies brings everything together in a tight knot. It’s one of the best fights that the iconic series has provided fans over the years.
Enter the Dragon
(1973)–
Bruce Lee vs. Han
Bruce Lee is here again of course. The “Hall of Mirrors” scene has become iconic in Hollywood. Many action films have paid tribute to the setup with the protagonist having to decipher which mirror is real and which are illusions. This all started with
Enter the Dragon
, where Lee takes down the main antagonist using his wits.
Batman vs Robin
(2015) –
Batman vs. Talon
This list wasn’t going to continue without Batman. After all, it’s Batman! In this animated film, watch Bruce Wayne take on Talon, the lead soldier in the underground Gotham organization The Court of Owls. The martial arts masters battle it out with a series of kicks, blocks, and punches in the bat cave just after the Dark Knight took on a swarm of soldiers alongside Nightwing. The entire scene outside of the 1v1 gets to see Batman, Nightwing, Robin,
and even ALFRED
get in on the action!
Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014) –
Captain America vs. Winter Soldier
This is arguably one of the best hand-to-hand fights in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe – two super soldiers battling it out with a complex history in one of the franchise’s most acclaimed films. The scene delivers tight choreography, brutal hand-to-hand combat, and impressive weapon mastery.
Black Widow
(2021) –
Natasha Romanoff vs. Yelena Belova
There’s nothing like a battle between siblings. This fight scene features two sisters who also happen to be two of the world’s best assassins. The fight does a great job of showing their skills while capturing the complex emotions of a sibling dispute. They combine their skills with the environment for a fun, brief fight scene that ends with a happier reunion."

There’s a lot to consider when building or updating your
martial arts school’s website
. One of the most important things is the copy you use. What exactly do we mean when we say copy? Well, in the simplest terms, “copy” is the written words that you use on your site. In a more in-depth sense, it’s the persuasive, marketing-driven language that’s used within those words! A number of factors related to your website copywriting can determine how you rank online against your competitors and the message you send to potential clients. Take a look at why custom, original copy is necessary and see what is important to focus on and what to avoid.
WEBSITE COPY DOS
Use Relevant Keywords in your Copy
The most important factor with your copy is using it to create a strong SEO presence. Plain and simple. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) ultimately boils down to prioritizing copy that is written for both
search engines
and the
human reader
. It’s imperative to put writing on your site that helps you rank high while flowing with enticing copy that helps visitors understand what you’re all about and why your school is special. Now – how do we do this at Kicksite?
Here, we go through an interview process with website clients and ask questions to find intriguing, important facts and information to tell your customers (see the next section). Additionally, we make sure that plenty of
relevant keywords and phrases
are strategically incorporated as we write your custom copy. These keywords are determined through research and tools that help us find what people search for, their purpose (transactional, informational, etc.), and how competitive the words are to rank for.
We know – that’s a lot. But it’s details like these that can influence if potential local customers have their attention glued to you or are checking out your competition.
Make Your Copy Personal
Google has a general framework they use to rank content called
E-E-A-T
: Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trust. All of these boxes can be easily checked by focusing on writing website copy that uniquely details your individual history, achievements, and knowledge.
At Kicksite, we go through detailed questions to learn more about you and your school’s background. This process covers a broad range of topics, from your daily focus on the mats to how your martial arts school has improved over time. From there, we can tell customers the story of how you’ve become the school you are and represent the values you hold.
Emphasize What Sets You Apart
Every martial arts school is different. Some are competition focused whole others are all about kids martial arts classes. Some offer programs or equipment beyond martial arts. With custom copy, you can emphasize those differentiators and highlight the things that make you special.
Instead of having generic, run-of-the-mill descriptions on your site, custom copy allows you to tell customers what makes you the best spot around. Do you have a sauna? Cold plunge? Weightroom? Anything else unique? If so, then write about it! Let the audience know that you offer more than your competitors. Your school is the best place for them to learn martial arts lessons and they need to know why!
Preemptively Answer Questions
When someone is going through your website they’ll inevitably have internal questions. What is this school’s culture? What classes do they offer? Can we sign up as a family? And so on and so on. A way to grab their attention is to answer these questions right away. For example, you can mention early on you are a school that focuses on competitive Jiu-Jitsu, or that you. Now the potential customer knows an important fact they were curious about to begin with. This effort also aligns with Google’s prioritization of content that is reliable, helpful and people-first.
You won’t necessarily be able to have all the answers on the homepage, but stay organized. By creating a strategically structured site with focused page sections, your potential customers can scan through without having to hunt down information. Headings, CTAs (Calls to Action), and other eye-catching features with important information can make the process of exploring your website easier and less stressful.
WEBSITE COPY DON’TS
Use Copy Straight from ChatGPT
Is
ChatGPT useful
for some purposes? Yes. Can it expedite processes for many things? Yes. BUT, that doesn’t mean it is should be used for everything.
To begin with, ChatGPT is not mistake-free. It tells you that itself! Second, there are so many factors you lose using ChatGPT. The personal touch is taken away when copy is written solely by an AI chatbot. And, there’s no guarantee of uniqueness – because these LLMs are scraping pages across the internet to build their responses, the copy you end up with could look similar to many others who want to find a quick solution. While Google doesn’t outright penalize AI-generated content, they
do stress
that original content is key.
Use Someone Else’s Copy
Duplicate copy is when the writing on one of your pages is identical to another page on your site OR other websites. This is another one of those complex areas in terms of penalties issued by Google, but there are definitely potential impacts to your SEO. Duplicate content confuses search engines as to which page should be considered the true authority. At worst, this can lead to lower rankings (and in turn, reduced traffic) and at best a worsened brand image when people see that your copy is nearly identical to another school’s website. You’d never want it to look like you’re plagiarizing. With custom copy, this doesn’t happen. Your website will have its own original copy, with unique attributes, stories, and offers to show clients.
Overdo it on Keywords (Keyword Stuffing)
Of course – as we mentioned earlier – placing strong keywords into your copy is crucial. Without them your SEO rank could plummet. Still, you shouldn’t inorganically force them into your website copy in a way that doesn’t sound like a human being would actually speak. If you do so, it will trigger
red flags for Google
as potential spam and end up hurting your ranking.
Make sure all the keywords you use are written naturally. If you haphazardly wedge them into your copy in an attempt to manipulate search rankings, your website will sound unprofessional and stiff and perform poorly.
Set it and Forget it
You have just finished your copy, launched your site, and are ready to relax, never having to worry about your website content again. Not true! When you create a martial arts website, you must stay involved to stay at the top of the game. This will include updating your site with blog posts, creating new pages as needed (when programs are introduced, instructors are added, etc.), and more, giving search engines more content to index. Continually adding new, relevant content indicates that you are an informative resource in the martial arts world. Don’t think you are just completely done with your website once it launches – building SEO is a long-term process!

If you haven’t heard, there’s a new blockbuster movie hitting theaters soon that’s rooted in mixed martial arts –
The Smashing Machine.
When does The Smashing Machine release in theaters?
Depicting the story of MMA legend Mark Kerr,
The Smashing Machine
releases October 3
and stars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as Kerr, a former two-time UFC Heavyweight Tournament Champion.
Who stars in The Smashing Machine?
Alongside Dwayne Johnson will be Emily Blunt, playing Kerr’s then-wife Dawn Staples, and someone special to Kicksite – client, mentor, and champion, Robero “Cyborg” Abreu as Fabio Gurgel, a 4-time World Jiu-Jitsu Champion.
Initial reactions to
The Smashing Machine
The film is already receiving a ton of attention ahead of its release. The biopic is expected to be a potential Oscar contender for Best Picture as well as Lead Actor for the WWE Legend. The early reactions provide high praise, with an 81% from Rotten Tomatoes and an 8.8/10 from IMDB (Ratings as of September 10). Audience reviews have described the film as raw, emotional, and authentic. It is receiving acclaim both for the powerful story and messaging coupled with Johnson’s dramatic performance.
The crew is on their first leg of the press tour for the film. It kicked off with a showing at the Venice Film Festival, receiving a 15-minute standing ovation. As the press tour continues, the hype is only expected to continue building.
Now, before you head to the theaters to watch it, here is some background information on Kerr’s story.
Who is Mark Kerr?
Kerr’s Early Fighting Background
Warning: Some possible spoilers ahead
The movie will follow Kerr’s journey throughout his fighting career, beginning with his UFC stint in the late 1990s all the way to the Pride Championships in 2009. Over the course of that journey, we can expect to see the many highs and lows of his story. Viewers will see how he dominated MMA with an 11-0 start to his career, his battle against a painkiller addiction, and his use of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs).
Viewers will likely go through many emotions as they learn more about Kerr’s background and how his greatness on the mat was bolstered by his wrestling background. He began wrestling as a freshman in high school, eventually winning the state championship in Ohio. His dominance didn’t stop there. Kerr would go on to wrack up a long list of accomplishments once he started wrestling in college.
Kerr’s Wrestling Accomplishments
1992 Division-I Champion and All American
3-time Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA) Champion
1992 2nd Place Finish at the World Cup (One ahead of future Olympic Gold Medalist Kurt Angle)
1993 & 1994 USA World Team Trials Winner
1994 World Cup Gold Medalist
1995 Silver Medalist at Pan American Games
Kerr’s wrestling success and his interest in mixed martial arts led him to higher-level competitions. His highly anticipated debut into the world of MMA came in January 1997 at Brazil’s World Vale Tudo Championship 3.
It was this event where Kerr cemented himself as a true threat to all fighters with his overbearing size and skill. He took down his first two opponents with ease, though he broke his hand leading to the title match. His Championship opponent was Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter Fabio Gurgel, played by Cyborg. The two battled for 30 minutes, with Kerr overwhelming him for much of the bout. Eventually, the ref stopped the fight due to Gurgel’s inability to defend himself and Kerr took home the title. Kerr had taken down three well-known martial artists and immediately had the community’s attention.
The next stop was the Ultimate Fighting Championship and the rest is history that you’ll see depicted in theaters soon!
Mark Kerr’s early career was nothing short of dominant, even grabbing four ADCC World Championships on the way. Shortly after, due to an evolution of the sport and his personal struggles, he began to lose matches more frequently, ultimately leading to his retirement. Today, Kerr is regarded as one of the most enticing fighters in MMA history. Some remember him for his best moments, others for his worst. Either way,
The Smashing Machine
expects to draw in many and give viewers a peek behind the curtain into the life of those who compete in combat sports."

SEO. It’s an acronym that’s thrown around all the time in discussions about websites and business growth. It also frequently leads to head-scratching – what IS Search Engine Optimization, and why should it matter to you as an owner of a gym or martial arts school? We’ll give you the rundown, plus touch on three key components of SEO and how Kicksite can help give your SEO a boost!
In the simplest of terms, Search Engine Optimization is the process of ensuring that your website is visible in the top results of relevant searches on Google, Bing, etc. But contained within that surface-level summary are a number of complex moving parts that require frequent attention and updates to make sure your website STAYS in those top results and doesn’t drift further down the list.
And what happens when your website is at the top of search results? Potential customers are more likely to click through, more likely to sign up, and more likely to help your business grow and put more money in your pocket.
Sounds pretty great, right? SEO is absolutely a worthwhile investment, but it’s a long-term investment. There’s no magic bullet or switch that’s flipped – most SEO experts agree that even with a solid SEO strategy it can still take
up to 6 months
to start seeing initial results from those efforts.
Here are some key components of SEO to help you understand why it’s valuable to play the long game.
1. Keywords and Content
Probably the most obvious component of SEO, it’s vital to ensure that your website includes relevant keywords and content related to the search results you are aiming to be part of. But it’s not as simple as just blindly stuffing your landing pages and blog posts with keywords; in fact, that can hurt your rankings! Keywords should be strategically incorporated into pages on your website and establish you as a valuable resource for people seeking information or answers to their questions.
The
website services
team here at Kicksite works with each new client to ensure the initial build includes copy that reflects your important business details and appropriate SEO keywords. Sharing your personal expertise through a blog is a great way to continue building up your site. And to aid in building out additional content, our
blog post archive
is a great resource for Kicksite customers to easily add compelling and informative articles to their site over time.
2. User Experience
Beyond the actual words a user reads, a positive overall website experience is also one of the important SEO components. Is the website mobile-friendly? How long do pages take to load? Does the page hierarchy make sense? Are any pages giving errors? Are there broken links?
These are just a sample of the numerous back end, technical aspects of SEO that many people may not think of. And technical SEO is a component where it especially pays to have an expert handling these updates. Chances are, you don’t have time to learn how to do things like create sitemaps or address indexing issues, much less carve out additional time for constant maintenance. The Kicksite website services team has many years and hundreds of clients under our belt, and we’re here to help manage your SEO so you can focus on training.
3. Backlinks and Organic Traffic
Another way search engines determine a website’s placement in search results is by evaluating their backlinks and organic traffic. Backlinks are when third party websites link to your site. This could be accomplished a number of different ways, but much like keyword stuffing, it’s crucial that these third party sites are actually relevant to your business. So, having your gym or school listed in local or online business directories could be helpful, as well as prompting customers to review your business on an online review site.
One beneficial way for Kicksite customers to drive organic traffic to their website is by utilizing
lead capture forms and landing pages
. Whether it’s advertising a summer camp or special event to current customers, or allowing new prospects to sign up for a free trial, there are a number of ways to create new content on your site that will continue to drive organic traffic. And these pages can easily be shared on your social media channels or through email and text communications.
SEO is a complex and ever-evolving process that can seem daunting, but doesn’t have to be if you have the right partner to help you manage it over time. Ready to take your business to the next level? The Kicksite team is ready and waiting to be YOUR partner and help grow your gym or martial arts school with a top-notch, all-in-one solution.

Fitness is considered a relatively simple concept by most: eat healthy and exercise. Then, there are those who go the extra mile in tracking calories, steps, developing training regimens, etc. But did you know that some have to go way beyond those norms of research and exercise plans just to stay in shape? Those people are women doing fitness training during menopause.
Working out and staying in shape as a woman in
perimenopause
or during or after menopause is much more complicated than you may think. With all the unknown intricate details menopausal women may not know about their fitness needs, there are two women in particular who are working to do the necessary research, spread the word and change lives!
These two friends,
Anna Martin
and
Dr. Jen Case
, have graciously spoken to us about the topic. Anna has been competing in Olympic-style weightlifting since she was 14, earning a reputation as one of the best weightlifters in the country, and is currently owner and head coach at
KC Weightlifting
in Mission, KS. Dr. Case is a registered Dietitian and Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist who holds a Ph.D. in Human Nutrition. On top of that, she’s a 13-time IBJJF World Champion who has been training since 2001 and is an instructor at Charlotte Jiu-Jitsu.
The Research
The two close friends are amongst the best in helping women achieve and sustain their fitness goals. Both have been implementing lessons learned through research and case studies to help their clients receive the best instruction possible. This includes reviewing the work of
Dr. Stacy Sims
, a nutrition scientist and one of the world leaders in female fitness research and promotion. Dr. Sims provides a highly-detailed breakdown of women’s fitness, specifically training during menopause, on her podcast appearance with
Dr. Andrew Huberman
. It’s a great listen for everyone, whether you are a woman seeking information, a man working to understand women’s perspectives, or an instructor looking to best train clients.
So what are the top takeaways from Martin and Case’s research? They’ve compiled this set of general rules and benefits for women to follow.

Rules to working out for women in Peri, Post or during menopause
No Intermittent fasting
Avoid Orange Theory-style training facilities
High-intensity and/or resistance training workouts (2-4 days a week)
Lift heavy (If you’re completing 10 reps, it’s not heavy enough)
Consume 40-60 grams of protein within an hour of training
Go 1-4 minutes at 80% intensity or full gas for 30 seconds (high-intensity cardio)
Do jump training (bone adapts to stress, impacting skeletal system)
Avoid
casein protein
when you can (found commonly in whey protein)
Creates hot flashes and is the slowest protein to digest
Benefits of exercising and eating correctly for women in Peri, Post or during menopause
Bone density increases or never goes away to begin with
Body composition improvements
Fat distribution changes
Spikes levels of growth hormone
Less fatigued
Maintained strength (women can gain strength quite quickly working out)
More flexibility to complete simple tasks as you age
Overall better mental health
Martial arts and menopause
The potential benefits of proper training for women are invaluable. And while weight training is the main source, martial arts has its benefits for women as well.
As an extremely accomplished Jiu Jitsu fighter, Dr. Case believes Jiu Jitsu is perfect for women as they age. Alongside the physical benefits, including low-risk for injury, practicing Jiu Jitsu is great for women to find a community dedicated to fitness. Grappling with like-minded individuals builds trust and keeps you active to maintain your physical health for your entire life.
Dr. Jen Case (right) takes a photo with her student Lynn (left) while sporting her WorldMaster medal. Dr. Case is a 13-time IBJJF World Champion and uses her Jiu Jitsu experience to help train women.
As a martial arts instructor, how can I help?
First, make sure you are as knowledgeable as possible on menopause and training during menopause. After that, put in the work. Incorporate high-intensity training for your older female students. That can be introduced via work on the mat, weight training, or a combination of both.
High-intensity mat work such as Wrestling or Grappling can be perfect for your students. When athletes are training above 90% intensity, they build strength while improving bone density, muscle, and tendon density. The right mat work can provide the perfect opportunity for that high-intensity cardio. For more details, you can check out
Westside Barbell
and their blog post about Absolute Strength
HERE
.
In terms of weightlifting, if you don’t have access to a full-sized gym for heavy lifts such as bench, squat, deadlift, etc., you can still incorporate other lifting techniques that will help menopausal women. Westside Barbell provides more information on those exercises in their blog post about Conditioning
HERE
.
While few trainers in any capacity think proactively or have any knowledge about the difficulties menopause adds to training, you can be an outlet for improving many lives. With proper education and care, you can contribute to lessening the worries of your students during a challenging time in their lives."

The UFC Fight Pass Invitational 9 that took place on Thursday December 5 in Las Vegas was a great event for our Kicksite family. Four of our customers (two couples) fought in the Invitational: Renato Canuto and Raquel Canuto from
Hybrid Jiu-Jitsu
, and Luccas Lira and Maggie Grindatti Lira from
Champion Fit
(rebranding to
Lira Jiu Jitsu
). Not only did this group of Kicksite users and partnered athletes all compete on the big stage, but they all came out on top! Out of the 10 winners, Renato, Raquel, Luccas, and Maggie represented 40% of those raising their hands in victory.
Match-By-Match Results
Starting off the night of Kicksite representation was Luccas in the second match. The Atos team member went up against Michael Pixley, winning in overtime. With the
UFC Fight Pass Invitational rules
, Luccas ended the night with 0 points after overtime ended, defeating Michael’s -3. (You can watch Luccas’ match on Youtube
HERE
at the 34:00 mark)
After another match, Maggie took the canvas against 19-year old Giovanna Carneiro in her first match after previously retiring in 2023. She used her vast experience to gain an upper hand on the youngster. Maggie took home the victory on a submission via heel hook to become 1-0 at the UFC Fight Pass Invitational.
“I got this opportunity and I knew it was something I couldn’t give up,” Maggie said in the post-match interview. “The UFC MMA was my goal 11 years ago. But I fell in love with Jiu-Jitsu. So don’t give up on your dreams [because] they’ll happen.
Another fight took place and then next up for our partnered athletes was Raquel. Raquel is no stranger to the Fight Pass Invitational, winning matches in the previous three events. In front of a strong Canuto crowd in her home town, she took on and defeated Michele Oliveira with a submission via rear-naked choke in overtime. Once she got the back, Raquel gave the supportive crowd a wink knowing what the end result would be.
“They know that the back is my best position,” Raquel said in the post-match interview. “I said this time I’d get a different submission (won by rear-naked choke in UFC Fight Pass Invitational 8) but it’s always there.”
Then, last, but certainly not least, was Renato in the co-main event against Jason Nolf, a wrestling specialist. Similar to Raquel, Renato was not fighting in his first UFC Fight Pass Invitational. He had previously won in Fight Pass 7 and 8 and was looking to win his third in a row. Throughout the bout Renato was tested, including losing his contact for some time, and putting it back in. Nevertheless, he came out on top by points in overtime: Nolf (-1), Canuto (0).
“I got to do a bunch of stuff that I was wanting to do…. I’m just a little bit frustrated it didn’t result on the tap,” Renato said in the post-match press conference.
We’re so proud of our clients for displaying their martial arts skills on the big stage! We love to see our users thrive and wish everyone who competes the best of luck in your competitions!"

At Kicksite, we see clients accepting payments from students in a variety of ways. While some schools have taken the important step of setting up credit and debit card processing, many others are still dealing with cash (or even checks!) or receiving money through apps like Venmo and Paypal. Although these methods may seem easier, we firmly believe that it’s vital for school owners to accept debit and credit cards and integrate that payment processing with their martial arts software.
Wondering why credit and debit cards are such a powerful asset for your martial arts school? Read further to dive into the key benefits that can transform how you manage finances and your payments experience.
Understanding Credit and Debit Cards
As a school owner, selecting the right payment methods is a key driver of your success. In an increasingly cashless and digital world, offering flexible, secure and reliable payment options can transform student and parent satisfaction, increase revenue and drive business growth. Accepting credit and debit cards using a payment processor like our friends at Basys, is an incredibly wise choice for your martial arts school.
Although digital payment apps have become increasingly popular, credit and debit cards are still the most trusted and widely accepted payment methods, providing a seamless way to process transactions for you
and
your students.
By using a payment solutions company like
Basys
, you can easily accept all major credit and debit cards. In turn, this gives your customers a simple, secure payment experience plus fast payment processing for you and your school!
Benefits of Credit Cards for Martial Arts Schools
Immediate Payment
Credit card transactions are processed and settled quickly, giving you your money faster. Checks, ACH, and other payment methods can take a few days to clear, but credit card transactions keep your cash flow moving smoothly and consistently.
Basys offers Kicksite customers next-day funding, so that hard-earned money is in your account as quickly as possible. Faster access to the money you’ve earned means you can focus on what really matters—teaching your students and helping your school grow.
Higher Sales Potential
By accepting credit cards, you’re opening the door for students to make bigger ticket purchases. Customers appreciate the convenience of credit cards, and are more likely to spend a little extra when they use them. In turn, this leads to greater sales potential for your martial arts school.
With Basys’ cutting-edge payment solutions, managing transactions is simple and efficient—both online and in-school. By offering students their preferred payment options, you create a seamless checkout experience that can help boost sales.
Student Preference
Credit cards are the preferred way to pay for millions of people. Providing the option for credit card transactions creates a hassle-free, customer-focused experience that encourages loyalty. When the checkout or recurring billing process is seamless, it can enhance satisfaction and increase the likelihood of return visits and retained students.
Customized payment solutions from Basys help stay on top of the game and give your students the modern conveniences they expect and the security they need. Tap-and-go contactless payments, mobile wallets – you name it!
Fraud Protection
Credit cards come with built-in fraud protection and chargeback rights, ensuring businesses are protected against fraudulent transactions. Compared to other payment methods, which may expose you to more risk, credit cards provide a safer, more secure option for your business.
Basys go beyond just processing payments—they work tirelessly to protect your school from data breaches and fraudulent activity. With systems designed to minimize risk, they’ll protect your business from potential losses and ensure that every transaction is secure. Advanced security features like EMV, tokenization and encryption help provide thecomprehensive protection your martial arts school deserves."

Blogging is an effective way for martial arts schools to establish a voice and personality, as well as build deeper relationships with potential students. Whether martial arts schools choose to utilize a blog on their websites or an external site, it can be difficult to drive the desired amount of traffic.
Blogs are gaining steam in the online sphere. There are
240 million blogs
, according to an infographic compiled by Quick Sprout, a website traffic consulting firm. People are responding to this communication medium, and 329 million people view 25 billion pages of blogs every month. Most people read between 5 to 10 blogs a day. Most importantly, individuals enjoy the essence of blogs. Eighty-two percent of consumers like reading relevant content from company blogs.
Blogs boosts SEO results and awareness
There are several reasons why blogs are sweeping the social media world. It is an effective way to garner traffic to your website and convert viewers into martial arts students. Part of why blogs boost traffic is because they have more inbound links than a website has on its own. Links are one of the most important aspects in Google’s ranking algorithm. Sites that blog typically have 97-percent more inbound links than other websites do. This statistic shows that blogs play a major role in attracting more viewers.
After people visit martial arts schools’ websites and read their blog articles, they can share them on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, among other networks. When people post the content on their social channels, they increase exposure of your business.
Content increases conversion rate
Aside from garnering traffic and raising awareness of your martial arts school, blogs offer tangible results. Content generates more revenue; 61 percent of U.S. consumers have made a purchase because of a blog post. Companies with more than 51 blog articles see a 77 percent boost in median monthly leads.
Blogs positively affect individuals’ purchasing decisions. In fact, 31.1 percent of consumers that use the Internet believe a company’s blog is the second most influential factor when it comes to buying services.
Target audience, purpose and length are important considerations for blog posts
For every blog post, it’s essential to consider the target audience. Does the content meet the needs and interests of martial arts students and their parents? What are you trying to tell them? Will the content solve their problems? After solidifying the target audience, it’s vital to consider the purpose of the content. What are you trying to accomplish?
It’s important to be intentional when drafting blog posts. First, consider the substance of the post. Does it warrant a longer piece or a short piece? Forbes highlighted the debate over whether people respond better to long or short posts and concluded it
depends on the end goal
. If you are trying to provide information about your martial arts services, keep it short and sweet. You’re getting to the point quickly. If it involves a call to action, such as a newsletter or email subscription, it shouldn’t be too long. Another way to get to the point quickly is to place visual aids like an infographic within the article.
While shorter pieces capture people’s attention quickly, longer articles may encourage people to share with others. In fact, posts that are more than 1,500 words garner 68.1 percent more tweets and 22.6 percent more Facebook likes, according to Forbes.
There are certain times of day that people are more likely read blogs. Sixty-five percent of people prefer reading articles in the morning – 10 a.m. is the most popular time reading blogs. In terms of days of the week, people typically read blogs on Monday and Thursday.
As you embark on your blogging journey, Jeff Bullas, a social media strategist, recommended bloggers use an informal style. He also suggested imagining the post is to one person who represents the target audience. When martial arts school owners start blogging, they will see increased Web traffic, a greater awareness of their organization and more students enrolling in classes."

What are backlinks?
You may be wondering “What are backlinks? Why is this important to me?”
In short, backlinks, also known as inbound links, are links from one website to another and are an efficient way to improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and boost credibility
.
The search algorithm helps determine the quality of your website and where it should rank in search results
. Backlinks help sites like Google and Bing determine the credibility of your website. This is key to your business’s discoverability and good SEO.
How do I generate backlinks?
Before you dive into seeking out backlinks to your
school’s website
, remember that quality and quantity go hand in hand.
The more sites that link to your webpage, the more value search engines find in your site. But, each site that links to your content should also be a trusted business or organization because they are vouching for you. If a website gave its seal of approval to anyone who asked for it, it wouldn’t be reliable.
If a backlink from a site is untrustworthy or unnatural, it will hurt your ranking. Search engines are able to detect relevancy. So if you’re a martial arts academy, it would not make much sense for a radio station to to link back to your webpage.
All of this being said, there are some simple, accessible things business owners can do to help build up backlinks to their school’s website. Here are a few of our recommendations.
Five easy ways to start generating backlinks:
Blogging
– Writing relevant, informative content even just once a month can make you a potential source for backlinks.
Further, including strong statistics and references in that blog content can help build authority and will generate backlinks as people find your valuable resource
. Create something that other businesses can trust.
Call out partnerships
– Chances are you have partnerships with other local businesses, industry organizations, etc. Extend those partnership by doing a link exchange. Reach out to those partners and discuss pointing to each others websites – this is a great way for both parties to reap the benefits.
Tie in other locations
– If you have multiple locations, linking them back to each other just makes sense. It’s easy and helps your customers see affiliations and sister schools quickly.
Outreach to business associations
– Check in with your local Chamber of Commerce and other business associations to audit where backlinks are possible.
Communicate with local media
– Announcing notable events such as tournament wins and belt tests can not only generate interest in your programs, but it can also create more backlinks.
Are there any tools I can use?
Now that you have the basic knowledge under your belt, you might be wondering if there are any tools that can help you along the way.
There are several free or inexpensive resources that can help you understand your current standing with backlinks and seek out backlink opportunities
.
Ahrefs offers a
free baclink checker tool
that scans your website and delivers your domain score, current backlink total, and the number of websites pointing to yours.
Sourcee
is a tool with a free pricing tier that helps you find journalist requests based on keywords you provide
. It’s a simple way to monitor opportunities to receive media coverage and backlinks within relevant stories.
HARO (Help A Reporter Out)
is another resource for finding media outlets that are looking for references with certain areas of expertise. Sign up as a source and you’ll receive emails when reporters are looking for contributors, and have an opportunity to answer relevant questions.
Once you’ve set yourself up for success and started to utilize the recommendations above, it’s important to remember that SEO is a long-term investment
.
Results will not appear
instantaneously, but your efforts will absolutely be worth it in the long run as you boost your credibility and discoverability through search engines."

Blogs are one of the
best ways to drive traffic to a website
, and also one of the least expensive techniques. The more content martial arts schools publish, the more likely potential students are to find them. While school owners may not think they have time to blog in addition to running their facilities, blogging does not require an extensive time commitment. School owners have a wealth of information, and they can establish themselves as thought leaders in the industry by blogging regularly. They can discuss the benefits of martial arts, interesting news or opportunities for competitions.

UTILIZE KEYWORDS AND BACKLINKS TO IMPROVE SEO
Writing relevant content that is valuable to viewers can improve search rankings. Increased traffic to the website will send a positive signal to search engines that visitors are finding the page useful, so the blog may appear higher in the results. Ultimately, this makes it easier for interested students to locate a martial arts school and enroll in classes.
To write a blog post that will improve your SEO there are two simple things to do: utilize keywords and link your sources. Utilizing keywords such as, “martial arts school” or “self-defense classes” is a simple way to increase your website’s traffic. Schools including relevant keywords in their content will be more likely to show up when potential customers are performing internet searches. The wider of variety keywords, the better.
Alternatively, link your sources, partnerships, and whatever else you can within your blogs. This creates
backlinks
to improve your website’s credibility and discoverability.
USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO GET MORE ATTENTION FOR BLOG POSTS
Since it can be difficult to attract readers to a blog, martial arts schools can leverage other tools to promote content and attract prospects, and engage current students. After publishing a blog post, martial arts schools should make a post with a link on Facebook and Twitter. If the school has social media followers, it’s a great way to attract more attention to the blog.
Conversely, the blog can be used to attract more Twitter or Facebook followers. Blog posts can include links to social media profiles to make it easy for prospective students to follow on multiple platforms. People who find the blog in search engine results may not be aware of the martial arts school’s social media presence."

Letâs be realâgenerating leads is one thing, but actually converting them into paying customers? Thatâs where most businesses drop the ball. If youâre running Facebook or Instagram ads but struggling to keep up with inquiries, youâre not alone.
The truth is, if you donât respond to a lead within the first few minutes, the chances of converting them drop significantly. People move fast, and if they donât hear from you quickly, theyâll find another option.
So how do you make sure no lead slips through the cracks? Automation.
With Zapier, MyStudio, and Amplify, you can capture leads instantly, follow up automatically, and book new customersâall without adding more work to your plate.
Hereâs how it works.
Step 1: Capture leads instantly with Zapier
Most business owners manually track leadsâcopying and pasting contact details, sending reminder emails, and trying to keep up with messages. Itâs exhausting, and honestly, itâs not sustainable.
Instead of juggling spreadsheets and inboxes, Zapier connects your Facebook and Instagram ads directly to MyStudio, so every lead is automatically sent to your CRM.
That means:
No more manual data entry
No missed leads
No wasted ad spend
Every time someone fills out your lead form, their info instantly appears in MyStudio, ready for follow-up. Itâs seamless, simple, and saves you hours of work.
Want to set it up? We put together a step-by-step guide to walk you through the entire process. Plus, youâll get three high-converting Facebook and Instagram ad templates to start bringing in leads right away.

Step 2: Automate follow-ups with Amplify
Capturing leads is great, but what happens next is what really matters. The problem? Most businesses donât follow up fast enough.
Research shows that if you donât respond to a lead within five minutes, the chances of converting them drop by over 80%. But letâs be honestâwho has time to follow up with every single inquiry in real time?
Thatâs where Amplify comes in.
Amplify is MyStudioâs AI-powered chatbot that automatically:
Sends a response within seconds
Answers common questions (pricing, schedules, availability)
Guides leads from inquiry to bookingâall on autopilot
Think of it as having a 24/7 virtual assistant that never takes a break.
Hereâs how it works in real life:
A parent sees your after-school program ad on Facebook and fills out the lead form. Within seconds, Amplify texts them:
""Hey Sarah! Thanks for reaching out about our after-school martial arts program. We offer after-school pickup, structured classes, and even homework time. Want me to send you a link to check available spots?""
From there, Amplify keeps the conversation going, answering questions and even scheduling their first visitâall without you lifting a finger.
Step 3: Convert more leads with less effort
When you combine Zapier, MyStudio, and Amplify, youâve got a fully automated lead system that:
Captures every lead instantly
Engages leads before they lose interest
Automates follow-ups and books appointments for you
No more chasing leads. No more lost opportunities. Just a simple, streamlined process that turns ad clicks into paying customers.

In todayâs digital age, user-generated content (UGC) has become a game-changer for businesses, especially local martial arts studios. UGC includes any contentâtext, videos, images, reviewsâcreated by your customers or students rather than your business. This content is often shared on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, providing organic promotion for your business.
â
But why is UGC so important, and how can it help your martial arts studio grow? Letâs explore the ins and outs of UGC, its benefits, and how you can effectively leverage it to expand your reach.
What is user-generated content?
User-generated content is any type of content created by your customers or community members. This can include:
â
Social media posts: Photos or videos of students in your classes.
Reviews and testimonials: Honest feedback from your students.
Blog posts or articles: Stories written by your customers about their experiences.
Videos: Clips of students demonstrating techniques or sharing their progress.
Why UGC matters:
â
Authenticity: People trust content created by real users more than they trust traditional advertising. According to a
Nielsen study
, 92% of consumers trust organic, user-generated content more than traditional advertising.
Engagement: Content created by users tends to generate more engagement. A study by Adweek found that
UGC posts
have a 28% higher engagement rate than standard brand posts.
Cost-effective: UGC is often free. Your customers create the content for you, saving you time and money on marketing efforts.
Virality: UGC can go viral, especially on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. A single post can reach thousands, if not millions, of potential customers.
benefits of UGC for your martial arts studio
Builds community: When students share their experiences, it fosters a sense of community. Potential customers see that your studio is a welcoming and positive place.
Enhances credibility: Reviews and testimonials from real students boost your credibility. New customers are more likely to trust a studio with positive feedback from others. BrightLocalâs survey shows that
79%
of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.
Boosts SEO: Search engines favor fresh, relevant content. UGC can help improve your search rankings, making it easier for people to find your studio online.
Increases reach: When your students share their experiences, their followers see it. This can attract new students who may not have heard about your studio otherwise.
Data and statistics supporting UGC
Increased conversion rates: According to TurnTo Networks, UGC can increase conversion rates by up to
4.6%
.
Trust and credibility: A survey by Stackla found that
79%
of people say UGC highly impacts their purchasing decisions.
Cost efficiency: Brands that incorporate UGC in their marketing see a 50% increase in content creation efficiency, according to a study by TINT.
Inspiring brand loyalty with UGC
Successful UGC campaigns not only attract new customers but also inspire brand loyalty. When people see others regularly sharing positive experiences about your studio, they are more likely to trust and engage with your brand.
Practical Steps:
Feature student stories: Regularly highlight posts from your students on your social media and website. This shows appreciation and fosters a sense of community.
Engage with your audience: Respond to comments, like posts, and share user-generated content. Engagement shows that you value your communityâs contributions and encourages more participation.
5 examples of large brands' successful UGC campaigns
Starbucksâ âRed Cup Contestâ: Every holiday season, Starbucks encourages customers to share photos of their red cups. This generates a massive amount of content and engagement. In one year, over 40,000 posts were shared on Instagram using the hashtag #RedCupContest.
GoProâs âMillion Dollar Challengeâ: GoPro features videos shot by its customers. The Million Dollar Challenge has become GoPro's most recognizable contest. The idea is to award some of the best creators in GoPro's community in exchange for their action-packed footage while encouraging people to upgrade to one of GoPro's newest camera models. These authentic clips showcase the product's capabilities and inspire others to create their own. GoProâs YouTube channel, filled with user-generated content, has over 10 million subscribers.
â
Coca-Colaâs âShare a Cokeâ: Coca-Cola's ""Share a Coke"" campaign personalized the iconic Coke bottles by replacing the brand's logo with popular names. Customers were encouraged to find bottles with their friends' and family members' names, take photos, and share them on social media using the hashtag #ShareaCoke. This campaign was incredibly successful, leading to a 2% increase in U.S. sales and over 500,000 photos shared on social media during its first year.
â
Appleâs #ShotOniPhone: Apple's #ShotOniPhone campaign showcases photos and videos taken by iPhone users. By encouraging customers to share their best shots on social media with the hashtag #ShotOniPhone, Apple created a massive gallery of stunning user-generated content. This not only highlighted the quality of the iPhone camera but also engaged a global community of photographers. The campaign has generated millions of posts and has been featured in numerous Apple commercials and billboards around the world.
Lululemonâs #TheSweatLife: Lululemonâs #TheSweatLife campaign encourages customers to share their active lifestyles, showcasing how they wear Lululemon gear during workouts and daily activities. This hashtag has generated a significant amount of content, with users posting images and stories about their fitness journeys. By promoting a healthy and active lifestyle, Lululemon has built a strong community of brand advocates. The campaign has not only increased engagement but also helped the brand to understand its customers better and create products that meet their needs.
Creating desire through UGC
You donât have to be a big brand to run a successful UGC campaign. Small businesses with a local following can harness UGC to drive engagement and conversions. Sharing content created by your users taps into the natural human tendency towards FOMO (fear of missing out), creating a sense of desire among potential customers.
Practicals steps:
Highlight real experiences: Share photos and videos of your students in action. Authentic content showcasing real people and real results can make your studio more appealing to potential clients.
Branded hashtags: Encourage your students to use a unique hashtag like #MartialArtsJourney or #KickWithUs when they post about their experiences. This makes it easy to track and share their content.
Building a UGC library
Curating a library of user-generated content can keep your marketing fresh and engaging. Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter offer tools to help you organize and highlight UGC, making it easier to maintain a steady flow of content without constantly creating new material.
Practical steps:
Create Instagram highlights: Use Instagram Highlights to save and showcase the best stories and posts from your students.
Facebook albums: Organize user-generated photos and videos into albums on your Facebook page to keep them easily accessible for new visitors.
Pin top tweets: On Twitter, pin top tweets that feature exceptional UGC to your profile for maximum visibility.
How to encourage UGC locally
To maximize the benefits of UGC, itâs essential to actively encourage your local community to contribute. Here are some strategies to get your students and customers involved:
â
Create a branded hashtag: Develop a unique hashtag for your studio. Encourage students to use it when they post about their experiences. For example, #MartialArtsJourney or #KickWithUs.
â
Host contests and challenges: Run social media contests where students can win prizes by sharing their stories or videos. For example, a âBest Kickâ challenge where students post their best kick videos.
â
Showcase UGC: Highlight user-generated content on your website and social media pages. This not only shows appreciation but also motivates others to contribute. Share weekly or monthly âStudent Spotlightâ posts.
â
Ask for reviews: Encourage students to leave reviews on Google, Yelp, and your Facebook page. Respond to these reviews to show you value their feedback.
Engage with content: Like, comment, and share the posts your students create. Engagement shows that you value their contributions and encourages others to join in.

5 ways real everyday users are using UGC on social media
GRWM (Get Ready With Me): ""Get Ready With Me"" (GRWM) videos are popular across various niches, from makeup tutorials to fitness routines and even mom-life hacks. In these videos, users film themselves as they prepare for their day, providing tips, product recommendations, and personal insights. GRWM videos are highly engaging because they offer a personal glimpse into the creatorâs life, fostering a sense of connection and relatability. This type of UGC is especially effective for brands in beauty, fashion, and lifestyle industries, as it showcases products in a real-world context.
â
Reaction videos: Reaction videos feature users reacting to music video releases, TV or movie scenes, and other viral content. These videos are popular because they capture genuine emotional responses, making them entertaining and relatable. For example, a reaction video to a new movie trailer can create buzz and drive engagement as viewers share their own opinions in the comments. Brands can leverage reaction videos by encouraging users to react to their content or products, thus generating authentic and engaging UGC.
â
Unboxing: Unboxing videos involve users opening and reviewing new products on camera. These videos are highly popular because they provide a detailed look at the product and offer the viewer an honest first impression. For example, tech enthusiasts often create unboxing videos for the latest gadgets, while beauty influencers unbox new makeup collections. Brands can capitalize on this trend by sending products to influencers or encouraging customers to share their own unboxing experiences, thus increasing brand visibility and trust.
â
A day in the life: ""A day in the life"" videos take viewers through a typical day in the life of the creator, showcasing their daily routines, activities, and interactions. These videos are popular because they offer a personal and authentic look into someone elseâs life, making them relatable and engaging. For example, a martial arts instructor might share a day in their life, including training sessions, classes, and personal time. Brands can encourage users to create ""A day in the life"" content featuring their products, highlighting real-life usage and benefits.
â
Role-play videos: Role-play videos involve creators acting out scenarios, often playing multiple characters themselves. These videos can be humorous and entertaining, making them highly shareable. For example, a user might create a funny role-play video depicting a customer service interaction or a day at the gym. Brands can engage with this trend by hosting contests or challenges where users create role-play videos involving their products or services, driving creativity and engagement.
â
Wrapping it up
User-generated content is a powerful and cost-effective way to promote your martial arts studio. By leveraging the experiences and voices of your students, you can build a strong community, enhance your credibility, and reach new customers. Start encouraging your students to share their stories today, and watch your studio grow!
â
By following these steps, you can harness the power of UGC to expand your reach and establish your martial arts studio as a local authority. Happy content creating!

The frustration of managing members with the wrong software
Imagine this: Itâs a Monday morning, and youâre ready to tackle the week. You log into your membership management software to check payments, respond to messages, and see how many new leads signed up over the weekend. But instead of a quick check-in, youâre met with a mess.
Payment transactions are missing, and you have no idea why.
A frustrated member left a voicemail because their account got double-chargedâagain.
Youâre manually updating member statuses because the system didnât process automatic renewals.
You need to send an email blast, but your systemâs email tool feels like it was designed in 2005.
Sound familiar? If you run a fitness studio, martial arts academy, or any membership-based business, chances are youâve dealt with at least one of these headaches. The reality is that bad software costs you more than just moneyâit drains your time, frustrates your members, and stunts your growth.
When your software becomes the bottleneck
Every business owner has a vision: to create a thriving community where members stay engaged and excited to be a part of something bigger. But when your membership software is inefficient, it becomes a roadblock rather than a tool for success.
Common complaints from business owners:
âI spend more time fixing software issues than growing my business.â
âOur retention rate is suffering because of poor member communication.â
âWe constantly have to follow up on failed payments, and itâs exhausting.â
âOur reports are useless. I canât track revenue trends or see whatâs working.â
A clunky system forces you into reactive modeâalways putting out fires instead of planning for growth.
The member experience: Why they leave
Think about the experience from your membersâ perspective. They expect a smooth, modern system that makes signing up, booking classes, and managing payments seamless. But when your software fails, their frustration builds.
Common reasons members leave due to bad software:
The sign-up process is confusing or takes too long.
Billing errors make them question your professionalism.
They never get reminders for upcoming classes or payments.
They struggle to contact your team because the system doesnât support direct messaging.
Fitness class scheduling is unreliable, causing missed sessions and cancellations.
A great member experience isnât just about what happens in your facility. It starts from the moment they sign up. If your software creates friction, members will eventually leave for a competitor who makes things easier.
The hidden costs of âcheapâ software
At first, sticking with your current system (or choosing a cheap one) might seem like a cost-effective decision. But over time, the hidden costs pile up:
Lost revenue
: Failed transactions, outdated payment processors, and limited upselling opportunities mean youâre leaving money on the table.
Wasted time
: The hours you spend fixing software issues could be spent growing your business.
Member churn
: Poor communication and frustrating experiences drive members away, forcing you into a constant cycle of replacing lost members.
Missed growth opportunities
: Without proper analytics from a reliable gym reporting software, youâre making business decisions in the dark.
What great membership management software looks like
The best membership management software doesnât just âworkââit actively helps your business grow. Hereâs what you should look for:
Reliable, automated payment processing
No more chasing payments. A great system automatically processes transactions, sends renewal reminders, and prevents billing errors before they happen.
Built-in communication tools
Email, text, and in-app messaging should be seamless. The right system ensures your members stay engaged without requiring third-party tools.
Easy-to-use member portal
Your members should be able to book classes, update payment details, and check schedules with a few clicksâon any device. Studio scheduling should be effortless, allowing members to reserve spots in their preferred classes without hassle.
Smart analytics and reporting
Data-driven businesses grow faster. Your software should provide insights on revenue trends, member retention, and marketing performance with an intuitive gym reporting software dashboard.
Seamless integrations
Your software should connect with the tools you already useâaccounting software, marketing platforms, and scheduling apps.
A support team that actually cares
Software is only as good as the people behind it. A great membership management system should come with a dedicated support team that understands your business and is ready to help. Look for software providers that offer live support, training resources, and ongoing assistance to ensure your success.
A team you can trust
The best software companies arenât just vendors; theyâre partners. Look for a company built by industry experts who understand your challenges firsthand. Transparency, trust, and clear communication should be at the core of their service.
Making the switch: Is it worth it?
If youâre dealing with the frustrations mentioned above, switching software might seem overwhelming. But the right system should make your transition smooth.
Questions to ask when considering a switch:
Does the software offer hands-on support and training?
Will my data transfer seamlessly without downtime?
How quickly can my staff learn the system?
Does it solve my biggest pain points, or am I compromising again?
The bottom line
Bad membership software doesnât just slow you downâit holds you back. The good news? There are better options. The right platform should empower you to grow, not force you into constant troubleshooting mode.

For local business owners, especially those running membership-based models like martial arts studios or fitness centers, customer churn is one of the biggest challenges to growth. Losing customers not only impacts revenue but also disrupts community engagement and word-of-mouth referralsâboth essential for small businesses.
Letâs break down how to calculate churn, examine data from membership-based businesses, and explore four actionable ways to improve retention.
Understanding customer churn rate
Churn rate measures the percentage of customers who cancel their memberships over a given period. To calculate it, use this formula:
Or simply churn rate = (canceled customers / total customers at start of period) Ã 100
For example, let's take a look a hypothetical example of membership data below:
November 2024 churn rate:
3.77%
(18 cancellations out of 506 total members)
December 2024 churn rate:
5.88%
(30 cancellations out of 510 total members)
January 2025 churn rate:
2.93%
(14 cancellations out of 478 total members)
A rising churn rate, as seen in December, is a red flag that requires immediate attention. If left unchecked, consistent churn leads to declining revenue and a weaker customer base. The drop in Januaryâs churn rate is a good sign, but itâs important to understand what factors contributed to both increases and decreases in member retention.
Januaryâs improvement could be attributed to the surge of New Yearâs resolutions, with people prioritizing fitness and personal development. Martial arts studios often see an influx of students eager to build confidence, learn self-defense, or get back in shape after the holidays. Additionally, well-planned January promotions or referral programs may have played a role in keeping members engaged. However, the challenge is ensuring these new members stay committed beyond the initial enthusiasm of the new year.How churn impacts revenueBeyond lost memberships, churn affects recurring revenue. If each lost member represents a monthly payment of $100:
Novemberâs lost revenue:
$1,800
Decemberâs lost revenue:
$3,000
Januaryâs lost revenue:
$1,400
While January shows improvement, the holiday season (December) saw a notable spike in cancellations, which could be linked to seasonal drop-offs or budget changes. Understanding these patterns helps businesses develop strategies to retain members during high-risk periods.
4 ways to reduce customer churn
While churn is inevitable, proactive strategies can significantly minimize its impact. Here are four key methods to improve retention:
1. Improve onboarding and first 90-day engagement
With over 2,000 locations, we know that the first three months are crucial for member retention. Let's imagine that this data shows that 160 members canceled within 0-3 monthsâthis indicates a need for stronger onboarding processes. Consider:
Personalized welcome emails with clear next steps
Automated reminders to encourage participation
Regular check-ins via email or SMS to build a relationship
2. Offer value-added incentives
Keeping members engaged means giving them reasons to stay beyond the basic service. Some effective approaches include:
Loyalty discounts for long-term members
Referral programs that reward retention
Exclusive member-only workshops or events
3. Monitor usage patterns and identify at-risk members
If a member hasnât attended a class in weeks, they are more likely to cancel. Utilize MyStudioâs insights to:
Track attendance patterns
Automate messages encouraging re-engagement
Offer temporary discounts or free sessions to inactive members
4. Create community and social bonds
Local businesses thrive on community. Foster deeper engagement by:
Hosting in-person or virtual community events
Creating a private social media group for members
Encouraging peer accountability through small group sessions
Final thoughts
Reducing churn isnât about a single fixâitâs a combination of proactive engagement, personalized touchpoints, and creating value beyond just the core service. By improving onboarding, incentivizing loyalty, tracking at-risk members, and strengthening community bonds, business owners can significantly reduce churn and drive sustainable growth.

â
Youâre hustling every day to grow your studioâbooking classes, managing staff, and making sure your members keep showing up. But letâs ask a simple question: do you actually know how many students you need just to break even each month?
Most studio owners donât. And thatâs a problem.
Knowing your break-even point isnât just a ânice-to-haveâ numberâitâs a business-saving metric.
What is the break-even point (and why should you care)?
â
The break-even point is the minimum number of students or revenue your business needs each month to cover your expensesâwithout making or losing money. Itâs your financial baseline.
If youâre under it, youâre burning cash.
If youâre above it, youâre building profit.
Simple mathâpowerful impact.
Why studio owners struggle without it
â
Many studio owners run things by gut feeling or vibes:
â
â¢ ""We had a full class today, so we must be doing well.""
â¢ ""Revenue seems up this month, so I think weâre good.""
â
But hereâs the truth:
a full class doesn't mean a profitable month.
You might have 80 students and still be operating at a loss if your expenses are eating away more than you realize. Without a clear break-even benchmark, youâre flying blind.
What goes into your break-even point?
â
There are two main things:
Fixed Costs â Rent, instructor payroll, software, insurance, utilities, etc.
Variable Costs â Costs that increase with each new student: event fees, uniforms, credit card processing, etc.
Once you know your monthly costs, you can figure out exactly how many paying students you need to cover them.
Real talk: once you know your number, everything gets clearer
â
â¢ You can price your programs with intention
â¢ Youâll know when itâs time to raise rates (or cut costs)
â¢ Youâll set smarter goals
â¢ Youâll spot warning signs before they become emergencies
We built a free tool to help
â
To make this easy, we created a free downloadable Break-Even Cost Calculatorâcustom-built for studio owners.
All you do is plug in your costs, membership fees, and average student count.
Youâll instantly get your break-even number, a profitability heatmap, and insights on how close (or far) you are from hitting your financial goals.

â
If youâre serious about building a sustainable, profitable studio, your break-even point isnât just another metricâitâs
the
metric.
Start here. Know your number. Make better decisions. Grow with clarity.
And when youâre ready to go beyond the spreadsheet, MyStudio gives you the real-time data you need to make smarter business decisionsâfrom tracking revenue and student churn to identifying your most profitable programs.

What if you had the chance to meet Bill Gates at the height of Microsoft? Or Steve Jobs at the peak of Apple? Would you pass on that opportunity?
In the martial arts business world, thereâs a name you need to know: Tu Le.
Tu didnât just operate a few martial arts studiosâhe built, managed, and scaled six successful locations, each generating over $1 million in revenue.
And hereâs the kickerâhe did it during COVID.
While businesses were struggling, shutting down, and bleeding revenue, Tuâs studios remained profitable. While others were figuring out how to survive, he was finding ways to grow.
How?
By identifying weaknesses in existing software and creating a system that worked for himâa platform that gave him back his time, revenue, and freedom. That system became MyStudio, the same platform that now powers thousands of studios worldwide.
And if that wasnât impressive enoughâ¦
Tu is also the first martial arts entrepreneur to graduate from Harvard Business School.
His expertise isnât just hard-earned experienceâitâs backed by elite-level business education from one of the most prestigious institutions in the world.
And at the MyStudio Summit, you get to learn directly from him.
The Summit: Designed to help you grow
If youâre serious about real, measurable, profit-driven growth, then you need to be in the room with the people who built the tools to make it happen.
The MyStudio Summit isnât just another conference. Itâs an intimate, high-impact experience, capped at a small group of attendees so that every business owner gets personalized coaching and strategies.

You asked, we listened.
Our MyStudio Summits have been creating real impact for studio owners across the country, and weâre excited to keep that momentum going. Next stop: Sacramento, California.
On May 15th, weâre hosting our next MyStudio Summit right alongside the
ProMAC International Martial Arts Conference
. This event is your chance to connect directly with the MyStudio team, get hands-on support with your software, and walk away with ideas and strategies you can put into practice the very next day.
Whether youâre based in Sacramento or just looking for an opportunity to grow your business in a big way, weâd love for you to join us.
Why attending in person makes a difference
In a world full of Zoom calls and online courses, attending in-person events still stands out and for good reason.
Studies show that in-person learning leads to higher retention rates. According to Training Industry, learners retain up to 90 percent of information through live interactions compared to just 10 percent in passive formats like reading or watching videos.
But itâs not just about learning. In-person events drive action. A recent survey by Eventbrite found that over 80 percent of attendees said they were more likely to implement what they learned at a live event compared to online webinars or recordings.
When you step into a room full of like-minded business owners, you gain energy, accountability, and real-time feedback. Thatâs what makes events like the MyStudio Summit so transformative.
What youâll experience at the MyStudio Summit
This isnât a lecture. Itâs a working session, a strategy lab, and a community meetup rolled into one. Whether youâre a new user or a long-time MyStudio customer, youâll walk away with fresh insights and clear action steps.
Hereâs whatâs in store:
Hands-on training to help you get more out of your MyStudio account
Proven strategies to improve lead-to-trial conversions
Techniques to increase customer lifetime value and reduce churn
Live Q&A with Tu Le, founder and CEO of MyStudio
A chance to meet other studio owners facing the same challenges and goals
Breakfast and beverages to keep you energized
These summits are designed to help you run a better business. Plain and simple. Whether you want to grow your revenue, save time, or improve your systems, this is the place to be.
Limited-time offer and early bird bonus
Tickets are just $99, and the best part is that your fee is
fully refunded when you attend
. Itâs our way of encouraging real commitment and showing you how much we value your time.
The
first 5 people
to register will also receive a
free ticket
to the ProMAC International Martial Arts Conference, happening right next door.
Even if you miss that bonus, you can still take advantage of exclusive MyStudio pricing for the ProMAC Conference: only $199 (regularly $399). Youâll get access to keynote speakers, expert panels, and networking opportunities with some of the most respected names in the industry.

If you're like most local business owners, especially if you run a martial arts studio, gym, or fitness membership business, you're probably juggling a hundred things at once. From teaching classes and training instructors, to handling administrative tasks and onboarding new members, your time feels stretched thin. But have you ever paused to consider the real cost of spending your valuable hours on tasks that aren't directly helping your business grow?
Opportunity cost simply explainedÂ
Economists call this hidden cost the opportunity cost, which is simply the value of the next-best alternative you give up when making a choice. Here's how this plays out in everyday studio life:
Teaching a trial class vs. building tomorrowâs email sequence
Shadow-coaching a new instructor vs. manually entering last monthâs payment data
Hosting a parent appreciation event vs. staring at an integration settings page
In each scenario, the first task directly fuels your studioâs growth, culture, or community engagement. The second? It just keeps the lights on. Every hour you invest in administrative tasks means fewer hours available for the high-impact activities that actually move your business forward.
The admin trap: Where your hours really go
Studies consistently highlight this issue. Small-business owners lose an average of 96 minutes every single day on low-value tasks. That's about three full workweeks each year! Entrepreneurs typically spend 36% of their workweek handling administrative chores like invoicing and data entry, and about 40% of businesses dedicate over 80 hours annually just to payroll management.
If you're already working 50-plus hours weekly, these admin tasks aren't just draining your energy, they're preventing you from expanding, innovating, and thriving.
The real impact on growth
Let's look at it practically. Imagine you charge $125 per month for memberships. Here's what reclaiming your time might realistically mean:
If you free up just 5 hours per week, you could teach an extra beginner class that converts four new members. That's an additional $500 monthly.
Freeing up 10 hours weekly could allow you to launch and nurture Facebook Lead Ads, potentially securing 8 new trials and converting 5 into members. That's roughly $625 more monthly.
If you reclaimed 30 hours per week, you might open a small-group leadership program, adding an additional $750 monthly by enrolling 10 members in a $75 add-on service.
These growth opportunities quickly vanish when your time is consumed by system setups, repetitive data entry, and administrative troubleshooting.
MyStudioâs White Glove service: Your solution for saving time
MyStudioâs core platform already simplifies memberships, payments, communications, and reporting. But the White Glove Service takes it a step further, fully removing the burden of setup, automation, and integration from your shoulders. Hereâs what that looks like:
Full-service account setup, branding, and data import, eliminating weeks spent learning new software.
Pre-built automations for converting trials to memberships, handling failed payments, and sending attendance reminders, saving hours each month.
Native integrations with essential tools like Stripe and Zapier, removing endless headaches from API keys and Zapier setups.
Personalized onboarding and clear launch checklists, eliminating frustrating trial-and-error that can impact your staff and members.
Ongoing optimization and dedicated support, removing the mental load and uncertainty around software upgrades.
Studios using our White Glove service reclaim 20 to 30 hours each week, reinvesting this precious time into high-impact tasks, such as curriculum refinement and community-building, leading some to double their lead-to-trial conversions up to 80%.
Work smarter, not harder
One martial arts studio owner from Virginia described the shift clearly:
âWe knew software could help, but we didnât realize how much time weâd get back. White Glove had us live in just three days, and the hours we saved allowed us to add a new midday class, bumping revenue by 12% in the first month alone.â
When growth is measured in hours, the cost of opportunity matters immensely.

The rise of short-form content: How to win the attention game
Short-form content is dominating digital marketing, with platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts driving engagement. As attention spans shrink, brands must leverage bite-sized videos to captivate audiences, boost virality, and increase conversions. This guide explores why short-form content works, trends shaping 2025, and strategies to maximize impact.

Think about the last time you scrolled through TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts. How long do you typically give a video before deciding to watch it or swipe away? Probably less than three seconds. Thatâs how fast we judge whether content is worth our time.
Everything today is designed for our shrinking attention spans. Dating apps let us swipe left or right in an instant. Food delivery apps suggest meals before we even finish typing what weâre craving. Even emails now come with AI-generated summaries so we donât have to read the whole thing.
Short-form content thrives in this fast-paced, hyper-efficient world. Defined as videos under 90 seconds, it has exploded in popularity, becoming the go-to format for engaging, bite-sized entertainment. And itâs no surpriseâour average attention span has dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to just 8.25 seconds today, making it even shorter than that of a goldfish.
How different generations consume content
Understanding how different generations engage with content helps shape a strategy that actually works:
Gen X and baby boomers (born 1965â1980 and 1946â1964, respectively):
Longer attention spans mean theyâre more likely to engage with detailed content. But theyâve also embraced short-form content for quick updates, news, and entertainment on the go.
Millennials (born 1981â1996):
They have about 12 seconds before losing interest, so while they like short-form content, theyâre also more willing to stick around for longer videosâif they see the value in it. They tend to prefer content thatâs both informative and entertaining.
Gen Z (born 1997â2012):
Grew up glued to screens, with an attention span of about 8 seconds. They love quick, visually exciting content and often use short-form videos as a gateway to something longer. 59% of Gen Zers use short-form videos to discover new things before diving deeper.
Gen Alpha (born 2013â2025):
This generation doesnât know a world without YouTube Kids and TikTok. Their attention span sits at around 8 seconds, just like Gen Z, but hereâs the catchâit takes way more touchpoints to get a message to stick. If it used to take seven times to get Gen Z to remember a brand, Gen Alpha might need to see it 20+ times before it clicks. Theyâre also used to juggling multiple screens at once, so static ads and long-winded videos wonât cut it. Brands need to get creative with interactive and immersive experiences to really connect.
Why short-form content works
Grabs attention instantly
People decide in seconds whether theyâll keep watching or scroll away. Short-form content gets straight to the point, delivering value or entertainment before the viewer loses interest.
Easy to share
Bite-sized videos are simple to consume and even easier to pass along. Social algorithms love content that gets quick engagement, making short-form videos more likely to go viral.
Designed for mobile
Over 75% of video consumption happens on mobile. Vertical, fast-paced content fits seamlessly into our daily scrolling habits.
Encourages repeat views
Quick videos are easier to rewatch multiple times, increasing retention rates and boosting performance in platform algorithms.
Perfect for modern marketing
Brands and creators use short-form videos to build connections, promote products, and drive engagement. Features like Instagram Reels shopping, TikTokâs interactive ads, and YouTube Shorts monetization give businesses more ways to connect with audiences.
Short-form content trends shaping 2025
User-generated content (UGC) is king
People trust real people more than brands. UGCâlike reviews, testimonials, and behind-the-scenes clipsâadds authenticity and drives engagement. Read more about
UGC here
.
AI-driven content is growing
AI is making it easier to personalize and produce content fast. Tools for automated editing, captions, and recommendations are streamlining the process.
Shoppable videos are the future
Entertainment and e-commerce are blending. Now, you can watch a short video and buy a product straight from itâno extra steps.
Behind-the-scenes (BTS) content builds trust
People love to see what happens behind the curtain. BTS content humanizes brands and strengthens audience connections.
Optimizing for sound-off viewing is a must
Most users watch videos on mute, so captions, expressive visuals, and text overlays are key to keeping their attention.
How to win with short-form content
â¢ Hook your audience fast
â The first few seconds matter most. Start with a strong visual or an intriguing question.
â¢ Keep it concise
â Viewers expect quick valueâdonât drag things out.
â¢ Use platform-specific features
â Each platform has unique tools (TikTokâs Duet, Instagramâs Reels Remix, YouTube Shortsâ audio library). Take advantage of them.
â¢ Encourage interaction
â Ask questions, run polls, and jump on trends to drive engagement.
â¢ Stay authentic
â Overly polished, ad-like content doesnât connect. Raw, real content wins.
â¢ Analyze and adapt
â Track performance, adjust based on engagement metrics, and keep improving.
For fitness and martial arts studios, short-form content isnât just a trendâitâs a powerful way to attract and engage potential members. But creating engaging content is only half the battle; converting that engagement into real sign-ups is where
MyStudio
comes in. With automated lead capture and seamless prospect nurturing, MyStudio helps you turn views into paying members effortlessly. Ready to take your studioâs marketing to the next level? Check out MyStudio and start growing today.

Imagine this: You own a martial arts studio. You've spent years building a strong community, refining your programs, and watching students transform from white belts to black belts under your guidance. Every month, students show up, parents pay their dues, and business seems steady. But if someone asked you right now, ""Whatâs your monthly recurring revenue?""âwould you have an answer?
For many studio owners, the answer is no. And thatâs a problem.
The power of knowing your numbers
Letâs say your martial arts studio has 100 active members, each paying $150 per month. Simple math tells us that your MRR is $15,000. This number is more than just a statisticâitâs your financial heartbeat. It tells you exactly whatâs coming in every month, allowing you to plan for expenses, growth, and potential challenges.
Without tracking MRR, youâre navigating in the dark. You might think your studio is thriving, but are you growing, shrinking, or staying flat? Are cancellations outpacing new sign-ups? Can you afford to hire another instructor, invest in new equipment, or expand to a second location? These are questions only knowing your MRR can answer.
Seeing the trends: What MRR tells you over time
Tracking MRR on a month-to-month basis reveals patterns. Imagine looking at your numbers over the past six months:
June: $15,000
July: $15,500
August: $14,800
September: $15,200
October: $16,000
November: $15,700
A small fluctuation in revenue is normal, but letâs say you notice a consistent dip every August. Why? Perhaps families are on vacation. If you see that trend in your MRR data, you can plan aheadâmaybe offering a summer camp or discounting private lessons to offset the seasonal decline.
On the flip side, if your MRR is climbing, you can see whatâs working. Did a new marketing campaign bring in more members? Are your referral programs gaining traction? Instead of guessing, youâre making data-backed decisions.
Predicting the future with MRR
MRR isnât just about looking at where you areâit helps you forecast where youâre going. If youâve been consistently growing at 5% per month, that means next month you can reasonably expect:
$15,700 Ã 1.05 = $16,485
Now, imagine if that growth compounds over the next year. Suddenly, youâre at $25,000+ in MRR, just by keeping an eye on your numbers and making smart adjustments.
How MRR helps you make smarter business decisions
Understanding your MRR isnât just about numbersâitâs about control. Letâs say youâre thinking of hiring another instructor to help with classes. That will cost you $3,500 per month in salary and benefits. If your MRR is at $15,000, does it make sense?
Maybe, maybe not. But if your MRR is growing steadily at 5% per month and you project it will be at $18,000 within six months, then hiring that instructor becomes a much smarter investment.
Similarly, if youâre considering expanding your studio or launching a second location, knowing your MRR (and tracking it over time) helps you make data-driven decisions rather than taking blind risks.
Whatâs a healthy MRR growth rate?
A successful studio should aim for at least 5-10% growth per month in MRR. If youâre consistently seeing 20%+ growth, youâre scaling at an excellent rate. But if your MRR is stagnant or declining, itâs a sign you need to focus on retention, pricing strategies, or customer acquisition.
Letâs say youâre adding 10 new members per month while losing 5 members per month. If your average membership is $150, thatâs an MRR gain of $1,500 per month. But if you tweak your retention strategy and cut churn down to 2 lost members per month, youâre suddenly keeping an additional $450 per month, which adds up to $5,400 per yearâall without bringing in a single extra student.
How to increase MRR
If your MRR isnât growing as fast as youâd like, here are some strategies:
Raise prices strategically â If you increase membership fees from $150 to $160 per month, thatâs an instant $1,000 boost in MRR for a 100-member studio.
Offer family and group memberships â Instead of just individual memberships, create family discounts that encourage parents and siblings to join.
Upsell additional services â Private lessons, advanced workshops, or gear sales all add extra recurring revenue.
Improve
retention
â Keeping members is cheaper than acquiring new ones. Focus on engagement, progress tracking, and incentives for long-term commitment.
Run referral programs â A well-structured referral system can generate new sign-ups at a low cost.
How MyStudio helps you track and grow MRR
Manually tracking MRR can be a hassle, but MyStudioâs
martial arts software
analytics dashboard simplifies it. With real-time insights into memberships, add-ons, and trends, you get a clear view of your revenue streamsâhelping you make smarter business decisions.
Instead of guessing, youâll know exactly how much revenue is coming in, whatâs affecting your growth, and what adjustments you need to make. Whether you want to expand, optimize pricing, or simply run a more efficient studio, understanding MRR is the first step.
Final thoughts
Running a successful studio isnât just about teaching great classesâitâs about understanding your numbers. MRR isnât just another metric; itâs the foundation for growth, stability, and financial freedom.
If youâre not tracking it yet, now is the time to start. And if you want an easier way to do it,

Veteran leader in health and fitness industry to spearhead Daxko’s next chapter
Daxko
, a leading software and integrated payments solutions provider in the health, fitness, and wellness industry, today announced the appointment of Jeff VanDixhorn as its Chief Executive Officer. With over 25 years of leadership experience in health and wellness, VanDixhorn brings valuable expertise as both a club operator and a fitness software CEO to his role. His appointment is a significant step forward for Daxko, focusing on innovation and customer-centered growth.
VanDixhorn becomes Daxko’s third CEO, leading the company founded in 1998 to help non-profit health organizations with memberships, operations, and accounting. Daxko’s growth has been driven by strategic acquisitions, notably adding industry-leading brands like
Club Automation
,
Motionsoft
,
CSI
,
ReClique
,
Zen Planner
, and
SugarWOD
. Daxko now powers nearly 40% of member-based health and wellness organizations, including large clubs, boutique studios, YMCAs, and JCCs.
“Jeff’s expertise in the health and wellness sector, both as an operator and a software leader, is unmatched,” commented Travis Pearson and Eli Weiss, co-chairs of Daxko’s Board of Directors. “His leadership, proven track record in building teams and growing businesses, and deep customer-centric approach make him the perfect fit to lead Daxko into its next phase of growth.”
VanDixhorn’s career spans decades, starting with the acquisition of his first club in 1995 and subsequent expansion to include multi-purpose fitness and racquet sports facilities in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. In 2007, he co-founded Club Automation. As CEO, he led Club Automation from start-up to becoming one of the premier software platforms in the health and fitness industry. Following Daxko’s acquisition of Club Automation in 2018, VanDixhorn served as Daxko chief revenue officer, playing a key role in driving the company’s expansion efforts until 2022. He has since served on the Daxko board of directors until this appointment, bringing invaluable customer and market insights and expertise to the company.
“Jeff brings a humility and servant-leadership perspective that resonates with YMCAs and club customers alike,” said Glen Gunderson, CEO of YMCA of the North and Daxko board member. “He is a purpose-driven and people-first leader who ensures customer needs always remain front and center. I’m confident he will harness the incredible assets of Daxko and build towards an even better future.”
VanDixhorn’s selection follows a thorough board process, ensuring a seamless transition and continuing Daxko’s commitment to health and wellness.
“As someone who’s devoted my career to health and wellness, I’ve seen the transformative power of life-changing software firsthand,” said VanDixhorn. “At Daxko, our core values are founded on community, and as CEO, I’m committed to strengthening our ties, enhancing our legacy, and fostering deeper partnerships. With our broad market reach, there’s significant growth potential. I’m dedicated to positioning Daxko to better serve our communities and to expand into adjacent markets.”

Daxko
, the leading software and integrated payments solutions provider in the health, fitness, and wellness industry, today announced the successful acquisition of non-profit software assets of
Christensen Computer Company
(CCC), an on-premises member data platform. This move is a strategic initiative towards modernizing member management solutions, aiming to deliver innovative solutions for nonprofit health and wellness organizations to engage communities more effectively.
Extensive research within the nonprofit member management space led CCC to choose Daxko as the ideal partner to help their customers thrive as nonprofit leaders.
In recent years, operational solutions have shifted away from on-premises solutions to cloud-based solutions due to management complexity, security risks, and challenges in business continuity related to physical hardware and software. CCC’s decision to unite with Daxko reflects a shared understanding that traditional on-premises models are no longer sustainable.
The union empowers CCC customers with access to Daxko’s full solution ecosystem, facilitating a seamless transition to user-friendly platforms. Daxko is a proud partner to nonprofits of all shapes, sizes and missions. With 25 years of experience, Daxko brings a profound understanding of YMCA, JCC, and Boys & Girls Club movements ensuring the delivery of optimized services and an elevated overall customer experience.
“This strategic move reinforces our commitment to delivering advanced solutions and exceptional service to the YMCA movement and the broader nonprofit community,” said Rudy Nieto, Chief Relationship Officer of Daxko. “Daxko’s understanding of the non-profit market ensures that CCC customers have the best opportunity to thrive in the existing technology landscape. We are deeply committed to partnering with key CCC leaders, ensuring continued excellent service during this transition and beyond.”
To guarantee continuity for CCC customers, Daxko will retain subject matter experts, including the immediate onboarding of key CCC staff members. Marcus Christensen, now Daxko’s Director of Sales, will collaborate with the CCC team, providing personalized options and support to CCC customers.
“Daxko and CCC’s shared commitment to innovation and customer success positions us to bring enhanced support and valuable solutions to the YMCA market,” said Marcus Christensen, newly appointed Sales Director of Daxko. “We are confident that Daxko is the best steward for CCC customers and their technology needs, well-equipped to lead them onto modern platforms.”
The CCC acquisition marks another significant milestone for Daxko, complementing recent successes, including
strategic acquisitions
, the establishment of
Daxko India
,
substantial investments from Genstar Capital and GI Partners

the addition of key leaders to its C-Suite.

A Third Path That Protected Their Mission
$300,000 Recovered Annually, Without Losing Trust
What Made It Successful? A Focus on Transparency and Choice
A Model for Other Nonprofits Facing the Same Pressure
Takeaway for Other Nonprofits
For many nonprofits, the hardest part of planning a budget is making tradeoffs that feel like compromises. Do we cut a program to save on costs? Do we raise membership dues and risk losing trust? Can we sustain our mission without asking more from the people we serve?
The YMCA of the Pikes Peak Region faced these exact questions.
Inflation was driving up operational costs. Program demand was rising. And like many organizations, they had already done the hard work of streamlining operations and optimizing resources. But even then, the math didn’t add up.
So, instead of choosing between increasing dues or trimming services, they did something different. They turned to Flex Fees; a small, optional charge tied to how members choose to pay. And it worked.
A Third Path That Protected Their Mission
The idea behind Flex Fees is simple: instead of raising everyone’s dues, you add a modest, clearly disclosed fee when members use credit cards. Members who prefer to avoid the fee can pay by debit, ACH, or other methods. And organizations can customize who’s charged; capping the fee and communicating everything transparently.
For Pikes Peak Y, this was the game-changer. The team worked closely with Daxko to configure Flex Fees in a way that aligned with their values and protected access for their most vulnerable families. They were thoughtful, strategic, and clear in how they rolled it out.
$300,000 Recovered Annually, Without Losing Trust
The results were undeniable. Since launching Flex Fees, YMCA of the Pikes Peak Region has:
Saved over $300,000 annually
Maintained strong member retention and satisfaction
Increased confidence among board and finance leaders
Reinvested savings into program expansion and community outreach
For a mission-based organization, this wasn’t just financial relief—it was mission protection.
What Made It Successful? A Focus on Transparency and Choice
The success of the Pikes Peak Y came down to three key factors:
Clarity:
Members understood what the fee was, why it existed, and how to avoid it if preferred.
Control:
Staff configured the program to protect equity and align with internal policies.
Community Buy-In:
By trusting their members, they received trust in return.
What stood out most was the trust they maintained with their community. Members weren’t blindsided. They were informed. And most importantly, they were given a choice.
Flex Fees was framed as one more way for members to support the Y’s mission, simply by choosing how they pay. Staff were equipped with messaging and FAQs. The front desk had clear talking points. The communication was owned.
As CEO Boyd Williams shared,
“It’s about ensuring the long-term sustainability of the programs our members rely on, without burdening the people who need us most.”
A Model for Other Nonprofits Facing the Same Pressure
The YMCA of the Pikes Peak Region isn’t alone in facing budget strain. Countless YMCAs, JCCs, and community centers are grappling with the same tension: keep dues flat, or cut what matters most?
But what their story shows is that there is another way. With the right approach, Flex Fees can help nonprofits:
Offset rising processing costs without rate hikes
Protect equity and accessibility through configuration
Build stronger, more transparent relationships with members
And most importantly, continue delivering the impact their communities count on.
Takeaway for Other Nonprofits
Flex Fees is about choosing smarter in order to preserve your mission, access, and momentum.

The Budget Squeeze is Real and Rate Hikes Come with Risks
The Third Option: Transparent, Mission-Aligned Revenue
Why This Works: Transparency + Choice = Trust
Equity Still Comes First
Operationally Simple. Financially Strategic.
Explore the ROI for Your Organization
Rising operational costs are nothing new for nonprofits but today’s economic pressures feel especially intense. From payroll and insurance hikes to facility maintenance and technology investments, the cost of doing mission-driven work is increasing. Yet raising member dues is often off the table.
For many community organizations, especially YMCAs, JCCs, and recreation centers, member affordability is a core value. That’s why more nonprofit leaders are turning to a third option: Flex Fees.
The Budget Squeeze is Real and Rate Hikes Come with Risks
Nonprofits today are navigating a perfect storm:
Inflation is up, but revenue is not.
Members are more cost-conscious, especially those on scholarships.
Boards are cautious, urging restraint around rate increases.
Staff are stretched, facing high expectations and tight budgets.
Traditionally, the only levers to pull have been raising dues or cutting programs, neither of which aligns with your mission or your community’s needs.
The Third Option: Transparent, Mission-Aligned Revenue
Flex Fees offer a new path forward. Rather than increasing rates across the board, these small, clearly disclosed fees are added only to certain payment methods, like credit cards. Members are made aware of the fee during checkout and are offered an alternative like ACH or debit if they prefer to avoid it.
The result? Your organization can offset processing costs, recapture lost revenue, and reinvest in core services without adding friction to your member experience.
Why This Works: Transparency + Choice = Trust
Some nonprofit leaders worry: “Will members push back on this?” The data says no. Organizations that have adopted Flex Fees report:
No measurable increase in cancellations
No decline in member satisfaction
Improved ability to plan budgets with confidence
Because the fee is optional by payment method, and not a hidden or mandatory charge, members feel empowered, not penalized. It’s a clear, values-driven conversation: “You choose how to pay. We use the savings to serve more people.”
Equity Still Comes First
One of the most powerful features of Flex Fees? Configuration control. Your organization decides how to apply it, including:
Excluding scholarship recipients
Capping the fee at a specific percentage
Choosing which payment method it applies to
This ensures the fee is never a barrier to access and your most vulnerable members continue to be protected.
Operationally Simple. Financially Strategic.
You don’t need a technical team to launch Flex Fees. With Daxko’s integrated platform and implementation support, most organizations are up and running in days. Your staff gets the templates, FAQs, and visual examples they need to communicate clearly with members. You get data-backed tools to track the impact.
The outcome? More predictable revenue. Less staff burnout. And the ability to serve your community more fully.

It’s possible to grow without raising rates, cutting services, or compromising on your mission.

Make Retention Effortless and Member-Centric (DXFactor)
Personalize Every Touchpoint with Predictive AI (Easalytics)
Turn Workouts into an Experience (Spivi)
Integrate with the Tech They Already Use (Technogym)
Build a Digital-First Community (SolutionOne)
The Bottom Line
Let’s be honest—if your gym or studio still runs like it did five years ago, you’re already behind when it comes to attracting and retaining Gen Z.
Today’s under-30 members expect more than machines and mat space. They’re looking for
connected, personalized, and community-powered
fitness experiences—and the clubs that deliver those are the ones winning long-term loyalty (and referrals).
At Daxko, we power 19,000+ facilities serving over 25 million members globally, and we’ve seen a clear pattern: Gen Z will show up—but only if your club meets them where they are.
So how do you do that? Here’s the playbook—and the partners helping make it happen.
Make Retention Effortless and Member-Centric (DXFactor)
Gen Z won’t jump through hoops to cancel, freeze, or modify their memberships. If your process feels rigid, they’ll be gone—and they won’t come back.
That’s where
DXFactor
comes in. Their
AI-powered micro agents
automatically manage and personalize the cancellation experience through intelligent workflows. Instead of a hard stop, members are offered dynamic options—like freezes, personalized incentives, or concierge outreach—that help
recover at-risk members without overwhelming your staff
.
It’s a smarter, more human way to keep members in the ecosystem—and it meets Gen Z’s demand for speed, transparency, and choice.
Personalize Every Touchpoint with Predictive AI (Easalytics)
From their second visit, Gen Z expects you to know them—and if you don’t, you’re forgettable.
Easalytics
brings
predictive AI to the operator’s fingertips
, identifying trends in behavior, risk of churn, and engagement gaps before they happen. Whether it’s nudging a disengaged member with a relevant offer or prompting a new challenge at just the right time, Easalytics helps operators act with insight—not guesswork.
With personalized engagement and better timing, you turn passive members into committed regulars.
Turn Workouts into an Experience (Spivi)
Younger members don’t just want a workout—they want a show, a scoreboard, and a social feed.
Spivi
brings that energy to life. With real-time performance data, team competition, and live leaderboards, every ride or group class becomes an event. Members see their metrics, compete with friends, and push harder—because it’s fun, immersive, and totally shareable.
Studios that use Spivi report
higher class attendance, stronger community bonds, and better retention
. Gamification isn’t a gimmick—it’s the Gen Z language of engagement.
Integrate with the Tech They Already Use (Technogym)
Gen Z is constantly connected. If your club isn’t part of their digital ecosystem, you’re invisible.
With
Technogym’s
powerful integration into the Club Automation app
, members can track workouts, sync Apple Watch or Fitbit data, and stream Technogym’s premium fitness content—all from one mobile hub. That seamless experience—between in-club training and daily wellness—keeps members engaged wherever they are.
It’s
frictionless, familiar, and fully connected
—exactly what Gen Z expects from their fitness brand.
Build a Digital-First Community (SolutionOne)
Fitness is social. And no one values belonging more than Gen Z.
SolutionOne
empowers clubs to create
branded, digital communities
that go far beyond the check-in. With referral programs, member portals, milestone tracking, and loyalty incentives, clubs become more than a facility—they become a lifestyle brand.
Gen Z doesn’t want to just “go” to the gym. They want to feel like they’re
part of something bigger
. With SolutionOne, your club becomes that community.
The Bottom Line
Gen Z isn’t hard to reach—but they are hard to keep. If you’re not meeting their expectations for digital ease, personalization, and belonging, they’ll churn.
But with the right tech stack—and the right partners—you can create an experience that feels curated, connected, and community-driven. At Daxko, we’re proud to power that future with:
DXFactor
– Intelligent AI micro agents for retention and operational efficiency
Easalytics
– Predictive insights to drive personalized member engagement
Spivi
– Gamified group workouts that boost fun, effort, and loyalty
Technogym
– Deep integrations for wearable and workout syncing
SolutionOne
– Loyalty-driving platforms to turn members into brand fans
When we make wellness personal, frictionless, and fun—
Gen Z sticks around.
Ready to meet Gen Z where they are?
Lets connect."

Why facility access is central to community engagement
Smooth, secure access sets the tone for a member’s entire visit. At YMCAs, JCCs, and rec centers, the check-in process is the first signal of safety, efficiency, and belonging. But long lines and manual processes can create frustration. That’s where
self-service kiosk solutions for community facilities
come in.
How self-service kiosks improve the member experience
Convenience and control for members
Skip long front desk lines
Check in with a barcode, card, or mobile app
Update account details without waiting for staff
More time for staff to engage
By automating routine check-ins, staff can spend less time scanning cards and more time welcoming members, answering questions, and supporting programs.
How kiosks strengthen community operations
Reduce administrative strain
Self-service kiosks minimize repetitive tasks, freeing staff from manual data entry and membership verification.
Improve data accuracy
Because members confirm their own details, records stay accurate and reporting becomes easier.
Increase security and accountability
Integrated kiosks ensure only active members and approved guests enter, keeping facilities safer.
Why mobile integration makes kiosks even stronger
Pairing kiosks with mobile tools creates an even smoother experience:
Members use digital passes or QR codes
Parents check in children for youth programs with one scan
Facilities send real-time alerts or updates via mobile apps
Together, kiosks and mobile tools extend engagement beyond the front desk.
How Daxko supports community facilities

What makes a great community event?
Event ideas that deliver impact
What you need to run events smoothly
Build a more connected community, one event at a time
Whether it’s a holiday celebration or a trivia night, community events provide an opportunity to connect your mission with more people. For nonprofits like Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCAs and JCCs, events that live outside your standard programming can fuel growth, boost engagement, and generate meaningful revenue. And with the right tools in place, they’re easier to plan and manage than ever before.
What makes a great community event?
Every successful community event should work toward at least one of these three goals, and ideally hit all three:
Community Outreach:
Invite nonmembers and first-timers to engage with your organization in a welcoming, low-pressure way.
Member Engagement:
Offer your existing members more ways to connect, bring friends, and see the full value of your community.
Revenue Growth:
Open the door for ticket sales, donations, sponsorships, and upgrades without adding new programs.

The Daxko team is thrilled to announce a renewed partnership with Welld Health. Welld will now handle all third-party check in programs for insurance companies.
How does Welld work?
Welld pulls member information to seed health records, check-in data to track healthy behavior, and membership status to track program ROI. For some programs, Welld creates prospects when referrals are received.  Welld was specifically built to suit the health record needs of YMCAs, JCCs, Boys & Girls Clubs, and local community-based organizations.
The platform integrates with your Daxko system to pull records automatically, effectively extending your member records into secure health records. No more hassle of exporting check-in reports, or holding your breath as you record Protected Health Information in an insecure environment. Our referral engine, program engine, and claims engine can handle any configuration for your business – from direct EMR integration for physician referrals straight through claims for programs like Renew Active, Silver & Fit, and more.
Welld helps nonprofits serve their community. With Welld, you can:
1.
Own your memberships.
Unlike other services that hold the membership outside your system, Welld believes that nonprofits should own their member to drive upsell revenue and facilitate a new membership after eligibility has expired.
2.
Screen eligibility in real time
. With Welld, you can know if participants are eligible before they ever check in.
3.
Get automatic monthly submission of member utilization reports.
Running several programs can be complicated, so Welld automatically submits utilization data for each program.  No need to remember deadlines for submission.
4.
Reconcile payment on a per member basis.
Using our deep history in medical claims processing, know the payment per program and per member with 100% accuracy.
5.
Flag ineligible participants so you don’t give away memberships for free.
Nonprofit centers are not told when members are no longer eligible, so Welld automatically lets clubs know who to deactivate in real time.
6.
Run your medical fitness programs.
With over 500,000 enrollments, Welld has unmatched experience in tracking outcomes and managing programs.
7.
Trust your data is secure.
Welld is HIPAA compliant and SOC2/Type II certified.
8.
Generate more revenue.
Welld Health will help your nonprofit maximize revenue and reduce the administrative payroll burden that often reduces the profitability of insurance check in programs.

Daxko
, the leading software and integrated payments solutions provider in the health, fitness, and wellness industry, announces its partnership with Epifany, an enterprise business intelligence solution designed to help businesses collect the highest caliber of customer data and feedback. The integration between
Club Automation
, Daxko’s management solution for member-based fitness businesses like health clubs, athletic clubs, and medically integrated wellness centers, and
Epifany
is designed to empower fitness businesses by enhancing member interaction and supercharging their performance.
Epifany distinguishes itself as a robust feedback platform that goes beyond the ordinary. Unlike conventional consumer surveys, which often employ a one-size-fits-all approach, Epifany takes a more nuanced and insightful route, recognizing the diverse segments of members that fitness businesses serve. It acknowledges that feedback from a loyal, long-time member can significantly differ from that of a first-time visitor.
“Epifany isn’t just another feedback tool; it’s a game-changer for fitness businesses,” says Wendy White, Chief Marketing and Partner Officer at Daxko. “This partnership provides our customers with a dynamic solution for gathering critical insights and strengthening their member relationships.”
Epifany equips fitness facilities to create custom surveys tailored to specific user triggers, delivering actionable insights that help businesses understand member pain points, increase sales, and reduce churn. The integration with Club Automation provides the following benefits:
Custom Surveys:
Tailored surveys for specific customer segments ensure higher response quality.
Dynamic User Flows:
Customizing survey journeys based on individual responses leads to more relevant offers and calls-to-action.
Real-Time Data:
Responses are instantly stored on the intuitive Epifany dashboard, streamlining response review, data analysis, trend identification, and qualitative feedback analysis.
Direct Member Interaction:
Leveraging Epifany’s dashboard to engage directly with member feedback fosters a sense of community, emphasizing the importance of members’ voices.
Executive Level Reports:
Access to executive-level reports simplifies data tracking over time and facilitates informed decision-making.
Lead Generation Tool:
Enhance lead generation by continually capturing vital lead information and automating sales tasks through the integrated tool.
“We understand that a single, standard survey won’t capture the nuances of diverse user segments,” explains Stephen Morgan, EVP of Business Operations at Epifany. “Epifany works closely with our partners to customize and automate surveys to the individual user segments that matter the most to them. Our easy-to-use dashboard helps businesses gather and respond to critical feedback that helps their businesses grow. We are thrilled about the opportunity to partner with Daxko and Club Automation, the industry-leading software provider, so we can extend our offerings to more fitness businesses.”
The partnership with Epifany promises to enhance the way fitness businesses engage with their members, providing valuable insights to improve operations and strengthen member loyalty. Through the integration of Club Automation and Epifany, fitness businesses are enabled to gather targeted data, enhance member experiences, boost sales, and reduce churn.

New integration equips wellness centers with tools to measure community health impact and secure future funding
Daxko
,
the leading software and integrated payments solutions provider in the health, fitness, and wellness industry, and
4GLOBAL
, the world-leading sports data and services company, today announced a powerful integration that helps nonprofit wellness centers showcase the real-world health impact of their programs. Organizations can track how their efforts prevent chronic diseases and improve community health and use these results to secure the funding necessary for future growth.
Nonprofit organizations are under increasing pressure to prove the impact of their work—not only to funders but also to the communities they serve. Fragmented data and limited resources make it difficult to show results. Daxko and 4GLOBAL address these challenges by integrating Daxko Operations with 4GLOBAL’s data tools, enabling secure sharing of anonymized data. 4GLOBAL then generates Social Value Reports, offering specific and meaningful insights into how wellness programs prevent serious health issues like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. These insights give nonprofits the data they need to demonstrate the value of their work.
“Quantitative proof is crucial for nonprofits—it’s no longer enough to talk about their impact; they have to prove it,” said Wendy White, Chief Marketing and Partner Officer at Daxko. “With 4GLOBAL’s data and analytics, we’re giving YMCAs, JCCs, and community centers the evidence to show that their programs are improving health and preventing disease. This data is key to securing the funding that keeps these vital services thriving.”
The partnership provides nonprofit wellness centers with the tools to measure and showcase their impact, including:
Improved Decision-Making:
Understand physical inactivity’s impact on public health to make informed decisions.
Compelling Reporting:
Clearly demonstrate the social value of programs to engage supporters and funders.
Service Validation:
Provide concrete evidence that programs are improving community health.
Strategic Growth:
Strengthen funding applications by highlighting areas of greatest impact.
Enhanced ROI:
Measure return on investment to maximize the value of data and insights.
“Our collaboration with Daxko marks an exciting milestone as we introduce our social value reporting and global expertise to the U.S. market,” said Alexandra Orlando, 4GLOBAL VP of North America. “This collaboration provides nonprofits with a powerful tool to quantify their societal impact, highlighting the significant role they play in the prevention of physical and mental health outcomes. By aligning with the mission of supporting whole-person health and well-being, we’re able to showcase how their efforts contribute to healthier communities. With these measurable insights, organizations will be able to strengthen their donor and fundraising efforts by demonstrating the tangible impact of their programs on the individuals and families they serve.”
The strength of 4GLOBAL’s approach lies in its unique combination of data, technology, and strategic insights, proven effective across sectors globally and backed by internationally recognized research.

Club Automation
,

Following Daxko’s acquisition of Club Automation in 2018, VanDixhorn served as Daxko chief revenue officer, playing a key role in driving the company’s expansion efforts until 2022. He has since served on the Daxko board of directors until this appointment, bringing invaluable customer and market insights and expertise to the company.
“Jeff brings a humility and servant-leadership perspective that resonates with YMCAs and club customers alike,” said Glen Gunderson, CEO of YMCA of the North and Daxko board member. “He is a purpose-driven and people-first leader who ensures customer needs always remain front and center. I’m confident he will harness the incredible assets of Daxko and build towards an even better future.”
VanDixhorn’s selection follows a thorough board process, ensuring a seamless transition and continuing Daxko’s commitment to health and wellness.
“As someone who’s devoted my career to health and wellness, I’ve seen the transformative power of life-changing software firsthand,” said VanDixhorn. “At Daxko, our core values are founded on community, and as CEO, I’m committed to strengthening our ties, enhancing our legacy, and fostering deeper partnerships. With our broad market reach, there’s significant growth potential. I’m dedicated to positioning Daxko to better serve our communities and to expand into adjacent markets.”

Daxko’s app is unique, offering integrated features like program recommendations, a consolidated calendar view, and direct donation tools that set it apart from some competitors. This app provides full data access, a single login, and in-app tools like barcodes and staff-facing features, enhancing the member experience and operational efficiency.
“This mobile app empowers mission-driven groups to operate on the go,” said Wes Gillette, Chief Product Officer at Daxko. “We are equipping staff with essential tools and integrating crucial fundraising features to let staff be efficient from anywhere.  And we are helping these organizations build valuable brand engagement with members via an intuitive program recommender and a fantastic modern mobile experience. It sets a new bar for efficiency and member-centric mobile engagement.”
The Daxko & ReClique mobile app introduces exciting new features for members including:
Integration with MMS:

One Login for Everything:
Simplify access with a single login, eliminating multiple usernames and passwords.
Digital Bar Code:

empower staff to manage operations and member interactions seamlessly from anywhere.
“I’m very excited about having an easy way to let members know that we’ve had to close or cancel something right in this app,” said Jennifer Elliot of Beatrice Mary Family YMCA. “Pickleball is exploding at our Y right now, so having the space schedules available in the app will make a great member experience and save a lot of phone calls to the front desk.”

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. May 27, 2025 –
Daxko
, the leading software and integrated payments solution provider in the health and wellness industry, has launched a new integration with
GoFundMe Pro
, GoFundMe’s nonprofit giving platform, that transforms how Daxko’s nonprofit customers manage donations.
The new integration between Daxko Operations and GoFundMe Pro empowers mission-driven organizations to launch flexible, mobile-optimized fundraising campaigns, with donation data automatically syncing into their existing Daxko Operations account.
“
This integration helps nonprofits work smarter, not harder
,” said Becki Irby, Director of Product at Daxko. “
By connecting GoFundMe Pro’s modern fundraising tools with Daxko Operations, organizations get complete donation visibility and operational efficiency. This option frees teams to focus on donor relationships and long-term impact.
”
Built for Modern Fundraising Campaigns
GoFundMe Pro enables nonprofits to launch beautifully branded, donor-first campaigns – including direct giving, peer-to-peer fundraising, recurring giving, customizable donation forms, and event ticketing. It’s streamlined design and mobile optimization help drive higher engagement, while the real-time data sync with Daxko Operations ensures that all gifts and donor interactions are captured in full. Whether you’re running multi-channel digital campaigns or community fundraising events, the integration delivers a campaign-centric approach backed by robust automation inside Daxko Operations.
Key benefits of the Daxko Operations & GoFundMe Pro integration
Automated donor matching
– Reduce manual entry by linking donors who gave through GoFundMe Pro’s software to Daxko members by name, email, or phone number.
Real-time donation syncing
– Donations, including one-time, recurring, and refunded gifts, update instantly in Daxko.
Complete donation history
– All gifts and associated campaign data appear in the member record in Daxko Operations.
Flexible campaign mapping
– Easily link GoFundMe Pro software campaigns to Daxko campaigns for consistent internal tracking and reporting.
Donor-centered giving
– Mobile-friendly forms, recurring giving plans, and fee coverage options support a modern, frictionless donor experience.
How It Works
The Daxko Operations and GoFundMe Pro integration streamlines donation management by syncing data between the two platforms in real time. For existing members, GoFundMe Pro matches donor records in Daxko Operations, ensuring that both one-time and recurring donations are recorded directly into the member’s donation history. For new or unmatched donors, staff can either manually assign records using the “Manage Online Donations” tool or allow GoFundMe Pro to create a new unit record in Daxko Operations, preserving all donation data. Staff can track and manage recurring giving plans directly from the member record, delivering full visibility into donor engagement.

Daxko
, the leading software and integrated payments solutions provider in the health, fitness, and wellness industry, today announced the successful acquisition of non-profit software assets of
Christensen Computer Company
(CCC), an on-premises member data platform. This move is a strategic initiative towards modernizing member management solutions, aiming to deliver innovative solutions for nonprofit health and wellness organizations to engage communities more effectively.
Extensive research within the nonprofit member management space led CCC to choose Daxko as the ideal partner to help their customers thrive as nonprofit leaders.
In recent years, operational solutions have shifted away from on-premises solutions to cloud-based solutions due to management complexity, security risks, and challenges in business continuity related to physical hardware and software. CCC’s decision to unite with Daxko reflects a shared understanding that traditional on-premises models are no longer sustainable.
The union empowers CCC customers with access to Daxko’s full solution ecosystem, facilitating a seamless transition to user-friendly platforms. Daxko is a proud partner to nonprofits of all shapes, sizes and missions. With 25 years of experience, Daxko brings a profound understanding of YMCA, JCC, and Boys & Girls Club movements ensuring the delivery of optimized services and an elevated overall customer experience.
“This strategic move reinforces our commitment to delivering advanced solutions and exceptional service to the YMCA movement and the broader nonprofit community,” said Rudy Nieto, Chief Relationship Officer of Daxko. “Daxko’s understanding of the non-profit market ensures that CCC customers have the best opportunity to thrive in the existing technology landscape. We are deeply committed to partnering with key CCC leaders, ensuring continued excellent service during this transition and beyond.”
To guarantee continuity for CCC customers, Daxko will retain subject matter experts, including the immediate onboarding of key CCC staff members. Marcus Christensen, now Daxko’s Director of Sales, will collaborate with the CCC team, providing personalized options and support to CCC customers.
“Daxko and CCC’s shared commitment to innovation and customer success positions us to bring enhanced support and valuable solutions to the YMCA market,” said Marcus Christensen, newly appointed Sales Director of Daxko. “We are confident that Daxko is the best steward for CCC customers and their technology needs, well-equipped to lead them onto modern platforms.”
The CCC acquisition marks another significant milestone for Daxko, complementing recent successes, including
strategic acquisitions
, the establishment of
Daxko India
,
substantial investments from Genstar Capital and GI Partners
, and
the addition of key leaders to its C-Suite.
Daxko remains committed to advancing the health and wellness industry through technology and strategic partnerships.

This strategic move aims to enhance fundraising capabilities for Daxko customers, including YMCA’s, JCC’s, Boys & Girls Clubs, and community rec centers, empowering them to make an even greater impact in their communities.
For nonprofits, managing multiple systems and handling manual processes can hinder their ability to fully focus on expanding their impact and nurturing meaningful community connections. Through these dynamic new partnerships, Daxko is actively confronting the challenges nonprofits face in managing these systems and processes head-on. By introducing new integrations with industry-leading fundraising platforms, Daxko users can not only achieve impactful results in their fundraising initiatives but also foster deep connections with donors and communities, while effortlessly accessing invaluable insights through analytics.

Funraise:
As a leading online fundraising platform, Funraise combines innovative digital donation tools with brilliant Fundraising Intelligence to equip nonprofits with the world’s best technology.
The upcoming integration with Daxko
is Funraise’s way of balancing community with action, delivering enhanced efficiency and sharp insights for Daxko customers.
“Fundraising is crucial for every nonprofit, big or small. That’s why at Daxko, making sure our nonprofit partners have access to top-notch fundraising solutions has been a top priority,” said Wendy White, Chief Marketing & Partnerships Officer at Daxko. “With Blackbaud, Bloomerang, and Funraise, Daxko users now have integrated tools that are all about saving time and resources, giving nonprofits the real power to raise the funds they need to truly make a difference in their communities.”
The forging of key fundraising partnerships marks a significant stride in Daxko’s commitment to offer comprehensive technology solutions and insights to its nonprofit sector. These partnerships complement recent milestones such as the launch of a
new nonprofit mobile app
,
strategic acquisitions
, and a
new key addition to its Board of Directors
.
The integration with Funraise is currently in development, set to launch to Daxko customers this spring, with integrations planned for Blackbaud and Bloomerang later in 2024.

DXFactor’s
OMAP™ AI agents — including the high-impact Click2Save — are now integrated into
Daxko’s
platforms, giving fitness operators instant access to proven AI automation that drives growth, retention, and operational efficiency.
McLean, VA / Birmingham, AL — [August 4, 2025]
— DXFactor, builder of revenue machines and creator of the fitness and wellness industry’s only Outcomes Micro Agents Platform (OMAP)™, and Daxko, the leading software and integrated payments provider in the health and wellness industry, today announced
product integrations that bring outcomes-driven AI solutions — including Click2Save and a suite of intelligent agents from  OMAP™.
The collaboration enables clubs, studios, and wellness centers powered by Daxko to easily adopt AI capabilities that reduce churn, automate workflows, and enhance the member experience — without the overhead of managing traditional software implementations.

said Dharmesh Trivedi, Co-Founder and CEO at DXFactor. “Daxko has set the standard for operational excellence in fitness technology, and by working together, we’re bringing Click2Save and our most effective AI agents directly into the hands of fitness businesses who are ready to simplify operations and improve retention — with speed and transparency.”
Click2Save: Retention Automation That Works
Click2Save, developed by DXFactor, is an AI-powered retention solution that proactively intercepts membership cancellations and delivers personalized offers or re-engagement paths — helping fitness operators reduce churn and preserve recurring revenue.
The solution is available both as a standalone product and as a deployable micro agent within DX OMAP™. Click2Save has already delivered results across multiple operators, including measurable reductions in churn and recovery of at-risk revenue streams.
Agents Designed to Deliver Outcomes through the Daxko Exchange
Agents from DXFactor’s broader AI Micro Agent ecosystem now integrate seamlessly into Daxko member management platforms – including both
Daxko Operations
and
Club Automation
– via web, widget, or API, with minimal configuration and fast time to value.
These integrations enable a two-way sync of key data, including membership information, payments, and cancellation requests.
The shared data powers automated experiences, such as guiding members through branded cancellation flows, capturing feedback, and reducing churn.

engage members more personally, and drive outcomes that matter.

Company News
By Wendy White
Published On  Mar 10, 2025
Updated On
Mar 13, 2025
Daxko has long been a trusted partner in helping fitness and wellness businesses grow, operate more efficiently, and serve their members better. Now, we’re taking that commitment to the next level with enhancements to product, service, and brand experiences —creating seamless experiences that make it easier for customers to get the most out of Daxko.
While you may notice this first in new product brand experiences as we roll out unified Daxko branding across all Daxko products, this move is more than brand identity—it’s about delivering real improvements across the board. We sat down with Wendy White, Chief Marketing Officer, and Matt Popinski, Chief Customer and Payments Officer, to dive into what this transformation means for our customers and the industry.
Q: Why is Daxko bringing all its brands under one name now?
Wendy White:
Daxko has been serving both nonprofit and for-profit fitness organizations for years, but
we’ve
heard a common theme — many customers
don’t
realize the full breadth of what we offer. By bringing all our solutions under one powerful name,
we’re
making it
crystal clear
: whether
it’s
member management, payments, CRM, or accounting, Daxko has it all — and
it’s
backed by one team.
Q: What product experience improvements can customers expect?
Wendy White:
Daxko has acquired many best-in-class products over the years across group exercise scheduling, CRM and marketing automation, and league management – along with our own great portfolio of solutions. But we left their original navigation and design experiences. Now, we’re focusing on unifying and modernizing the experience across our platforms. Transitioning between products will be smooth, and the familiarity of the look and feel will enhance the user experience and onboarding.
Matt Popinski:
Customers will start to notice a cohesive experience – a more intuitive interface, consistent design, and a smoother workflow across all Daxko products. First, you’ll see enhancements in Daxko Operations, Club Automation, and Zen Planner.
Q: How will this transition create a better experience for customers?
Matt Popinski:
One of the biggest benefits is simplified communication. Customers no longer have to navigate different brands or service teams—we’re bringing everything together under a single, unified support system. That means fewer handoffs, faster response times, and a more personalized, efficient experience.
Wendy White:
Beyond that, this move sends a strong message: Daxko is fully invested in every product we offer. Our customers want confidence that the company behind their technology is actively innovating and improving. This unification reinforces that commitment.
Q: What specific changes will customers start to see first?
Matt Popinski:
A few big ones! First, more proactive outreach—we’re doubling down on customer success, making sure customers have the guidance and resources they need to thrive. We’re also rolling out updated communication templates to reflect a single, unified Daxko voice.
Wendy White:
Visually, the first thing customers will notice is new branding across all Daxko products. We’re integrating the Daxko name into all our solutions while keeping product names familiar. Over the next few months, email addresses, websites, and support documentation will transition to reflect this cohesive experience.
Q: How is Daxko improving the customer support experience along with this?
Wendy White:
We’ve always prioritized customer experience, but now, we’re raising the bar. One of our biggest initiatives is getting our top experts closer to customers — direct support access to product experts who can provide real-time solutions.
Matt Popinski:
We’re also tackling a long-standing challenge — support transparency. Customers will now have clearer visibility into the status of their service requests, along with faster defect resolution and more direct updates. Same for billing, our new billing portal makes it even easier to see it all in one spot.
Q: How is Daxko making it easier for customers to get support and training?
Wendy White
:
Customers expect flexibility in how they engage with support—some prefer chat, some email, some phone, and some prefer social channels they are already involved in. We’re expanding our service channels to meet them where they are.
Matt Popinski
:
We’ve always had a robust portfolio of customer training, but we’re expanding it. We’re also launching free weekly training sessions tailored to real-world customer needs—whether it’s preparing for summer camp registration at a YMCA or running seasonal programming at a fitness club.
Q: How is Daxko ensuring these changes make a real impact for customers?
Wendy White:
We’re not making changes in a vacuum — customer feedback is at the heart of this. We constantly collect input from NPS scores, CSAT surveys, advisory boards, and direct conversations, and we’ll continue using that data to refine our strategy, our products, and our service.
Matt Popinski:
We’re also introducing customer system adoption audits, helping customers maximize the tools they already have. And with real-time support tracking, customers will always know where they stand.
Q: What excites you most about this transformation?
Wendy White:
The energy inside Daxko right now is incredible. We’re leaning into our vision and values in a way that prioritizes customers like never before—and you can feel that momentum.
Matt Popinski:
For me, it’s about deepening our customer relationships. Hearing their stories, solving their challenges, and helping them make a bigger impact in their communities.
Q: Where can customers go to learn more?
Wendy White:
The Daxko Help Center is the best place to start—customers can find knowledge base articles, chat support, and find other direct ways to reach us.
Matt Popinski:
We’re always listening. Your feedback doesn’t just matter—it drives everything we do.
What to Expect Next: Immediate Changes and Long-Term Benefits
As we refresh the Daxko brand, customers will first notice visual updates across our platforms. Over the coming months,
we’ll
continue rolling out enhanced support tools, training resources, and user experience improvements to deliver an even stronger, more unified experience.
Stronger Together
This transformation isn’t just about a new look—it’s about elevating the entire customer experience. As Daxko evolves, fitness organizations can expect more efficiency, innovation, and impact—all backed by a company that’s more focused than ever on helping them succeed.
